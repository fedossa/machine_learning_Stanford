# Week 1

## What is Machine Learning?

Arthur Samuel described it as: **"the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."** 
This is an older, informal definition.

Modern: Tom Mitchell (1998) defines machine learning by saying that a well-posed learning problem is defined as follows. 

- **Well-posed Learning Problem: A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.**

In the checkers example 

- E is the experience of playing the game 10,000's of times against itself. 
- T is the task of playing checkers
- P is probability of winning the next game of checkers. 


Two types of ML algorithms: 

- supervised learning
- unsupervised learning. 


Other types: reinforcement learning, recommended systems.


## Supervised Learning

- Regression problem: Where you are trying to fit a model to explain a continuous
variable by using a predictor. 

- Classification Problem: Where you are trying to fit a model to explain a 
bernoulli/binomial variable by using a predictor. - When you have multiple
predictors it makes sense to visualize it with the predictors and point label the
outcome variable. 


### Supervised Learning (note)
In supervised learning, we are given a data set and already know what our correct
output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the
input and the output.

Supervised learning problems are categorized into "regression" and "classification" 
problems. In a regression problem, we are trying to predict results within a 
continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some 
continuous function. 

In a classification problem, we are instead trying to predict results in a 
discrete output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into 
discrete categories.

Example 1:

Given data about the size of houses on the real estate market, try to predict 
their price. Price as a function of size is a continuous output, so this is a 
regression problem.

We could turn this example into a classification problem by instead making our 
output about whether the house "sells for more or less than the asking price." 
Here we are classifying the houses based on price into two discrete categories.

Example 2:

(a) Regression - Given a picture of a person, we have to predict their age on the
basis of the given picture

(b) Classification - Given a patient with a tumor, we have to predict whether the
tumor is malignant or benign.

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what 
our results should look like. We can derive structure from data where we don't 
necessarily know the effect of the variables.

We can derive this structure by clustering the data based on relationships among 
the variables in the data.

With unsupervised learning there is no feedback based on the prediction results.

Example:

Clustering: Take a collection of 1,000,000 different genes, and find a way to 
automatically group these genes into groups that are somehow similar or related 
by different variables, such as lifespan, location, roles, and so on.

Non-clustering: The "Cocktail Party Algorithm", allows you to find structure in 
a chaotic environment. (i.e. identifying individual voices and music from a mesh 
of sounds at a cocktail party).


## Model Representation


To establish notation for future use, we’ll use $x^{i}$ to denote the “input” 
variables (living area in this example), also called input features, and $y^{i}$
to denote the “output” or target variable that we are trying to predict (price). 
A pair ($x^{i}$ , $y^{i}$) is called a training example, and the dataset that 
we’ll be using to learn—a list of m training examples {($x^{(i)}$ , $y^{(i)}$ ); 
i = 1, . . . , m—is called a training set. Note that the superscript “(i)” in the 
notation is simply an index into the training set, and has nothing to do with 
exponentiation. We will also use X to denote the space of input values, and Y to 
denote the space of output values. In this example, X = Y = ℝ.

To describe the supervised learning problem slightly more formally, our goal is, 
given a training set, to learn a function h : X → Y so that h(x) is a “good” 
predictor for the corresponding value of y. For historical reasons, this function 
h is called a hypothesis. Seen pictorially, the process is therefore like this:

When the target variable that we’re trying to predict is continuous, such as in 
our housing example, we call the learning problem a regression problem. When y 
can take on only a small number of discrete values (such as if, given the living 
area, we wanted to predict if a dwelling is a house or an apartment, say), we 
call it a classification problem.


## Cost Function

We can measure the accuracy of our hypothesis function by using a cost function. 
This takes an average difference (actually a fancier version of an average) of 
all the results of the hypothesis with inputs from x's and the actual output y's.

$J(\theta_0, \theta_1) = \dfrac {1}{2m} \displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^m \left ( \hat{y}_{i}- y_{i} \right)^2 = \dfrac {1}{2m} \displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^m \left (h_\theta (x_{i}) - y_{i} \right)^2$

To break it apart, it is $\frac{1}{2} \bar{x}$ where $\bar{x}$ is the mean of the 
squares of $h_\theta (x_{i}) - y_{i}$, or the difference between the predicted 
value and the actual value.

This function is otherwise called the **"Squared error function"**, or **"Mean squared error"**. The mean is halved $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$ as a convenience for the 
computation of the gradient descent, as the derivative term of the square function
will cancel out the $\frac{1}{2}$ term. 

The following image summarizes what the cost function does:
