Arthur Samuel described it as: “the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.” This is an older, informal definition. Modern: Tom Mitchell (1998) defines machine learning by saying that a well-posed learning problem is defined as follows. Well-posed Learning Problem: A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. In the checkers example E is the experience of playing the game 10,000’s of times against itself. T is the task of playing checkers P is probability of winning the next game of checkers. Two types of ML algorithms: supervised learning unsupervised learning. Other types: reinforcement learning, recommended systems. 1.2 Supervised Learning Regression problem: Where you are trying to fit a model to explain a continuous variable by using a predictor. Classification Problem: Where you are trying to fit a model to explain a bernoulli/binomial variable by using a predictor. - When you have multiple predictors it makes sense to visualize it with the predictors and point label the outcome variable. 1.2.1 Supervised Learning (note) In supervised learning, we are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output. Supervised learning problems are categorized into “regression” and “classification” problems. In a regression problem, we are trying to predict results within a continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function. In a classification problem, we are instead trying to predict results in a discrete output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories. Example 1: Given data about the size of houses on the real estate market, try to predict their price. Price as a function of size is a continuous output, so this is a regression problem. We could turn this example into a classification problem by instead making our output about whether the house “sells for more or less than the asking price.” Here we are classifying the houses based on price into two discrete categories. Example 2: Regression - Given a picture of a person, we have to predict their age on the basis of the given picture Classification - Given a patient with a tumor, we have to predict whether the tumor is malignant or benign. 1.3 Unsupervised Learning Unsupervised learning allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like. We can derive structure from data where we don’t necessarily know the effect of the variables. We can derive this structure by clustering the data based on relationships among the variables in the data. With unsupervised learning there is no feedback based on the prediction results. Example: Clustering: Take a collection of 1,000,000 different genes, and find a way to automatically group these genes into groups that are somehow similar or related by different variables, such as lifespan, location, roles, and so on. Non-clustering: The “Cocktail Party Algorithm”, allows you to find structure in a chaotic environment. (i.e. identifying individual voices and music from a mesh of sounds at a cocktail party). 1.4 Model Representation To establish notation for future use, we’ll use \\(x^{i}\\) to denote the “input” variables (living area in this example), also called input features, and \\(y^{i}\\) to denote the “output” or target variable that we are trying to predict (price). A pair (\\(x^{i}\\) , \\(y^{i}\\)) is called a training example, and the dataset that we’ll be using to learn—a list of m training examples {(\\(x^{(i)}\\) , \\(y^{(i)}\\) ); i = 1, . . . , m—is called a training set. Note that the superscript “(i)” in the notation is simply an index into the training set, and has nothing to do with exponentiation. We will also use X to denote the space of input values, and Y to denote the space of output values. In this example, X = Y = ℝ. To describe the supervised learning problem slightly more formally, our goal is, given a training set, to learn a function h : X → Y so that h(x) is a “good” predictor for the corresponding value of y. For historical reasons, this function h is called a hypothesis. Seen pictorially, the process is therefore like this: Model Representation When the target variable that we’re trying to predict is continuous, such as in our housing example, we call the learning problem a regression problem. When y can take on only a small number of discrete values (such as if, given the living area, we wanted to predict if a dwelling is a house or an apartment, say), we call it a classification problem. 1.5 Cost Function We can measure the accuracy of our hypothesis function by using a cost function. This takes an average difference (actually a fancier version of an average) of all the results of the hypothesis with inputs from x’s and the actual output y’s. \\(J(\\theta_0, \\theta_1) = \\dfrac {1}{2m} \\displaystyle \\sum _{i=1}^m \\left ( \\hat{y}_{i}- y_{i} \\right)^2 = \\dfrac {1}{2m} \\displaystyle \\sum _{i=1}^m \\left (h_\\theta (x_{i}) - y_{i} \\right)^2\\) To break it apart, it is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\bar{x}\\) where \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the mean of the squares of \\(h_\\theta (x_{i}) - y_{i}\\), or the difference between the predicted value and the actual value. This function is otherwise called the “Squared error function”, or “Mean squared error”. The mean is halved \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\) as a convenience for the computation of the gradient descent, as the derivative term of the square function will cancel out the \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) term. The following image summarizes what the cost function does: Cost function summary 1.6 Cost Function - Intution I If we try to think of it in visual terms, our training data set is scattered on the x-y plane. We are trying to make a straight line (defined by \\(h_\\theta(x)\\)) which passes through these scattered data points. Our objective is to get the best possible line. The best possible line will be such so that the average squared vertical distances of the scattered points from the line will be the least. Ideally, the line should pass through all the points of our training data set. In such a case, the value of \\(J(\\theta_0, \\theta_1)\\) will be 0. The following example shows the ideal situation where we have a cost function of 0. Zero cost function When \\(\\theta_1 = 1\\), we get a slope of 1 which goes through every single data point in our model. Conversely, when \\(\\theta_1 = 0.5\\), we see the vertical distance from our fit to the data points increase. 0.5 \\(\\theta\\) This increases our cost function to 0.58. Plotting several other points yields to the following graph: Cost Function Graph for different values of \\(\\theta\\) Thus as a goal, we should try to minimize the cost function. In this case, \\(\\theta_1 = 1\\) is our global minimum. 1.7 Cost Function - Intution II A contour plot is a graph that contains many contour lines. A contour line of a two variable function has a constant value at all points of the same line. An example of such a graph is the one to the right below. Contour Plot - iso things in microeconomics Taking any color and going along the ‘circle’, one would expect to get the same value of the cost function. For example, the three green points found on the green line above have the same value for \\(J(\\theta_0,\\theta_1)\\) and as a result, they are found along the same line. The circled x displays the value of the cost function for the graph on the left when \\(\\theta_0 = 800\\) and \\(\\theta_1 = -0.15\\). Taking another h(x) and plotting its contour plot, one gets the following graphs: When \\(\\theta_0 = 360\\) and \\(\\theta_1 = 0\\), the value of \\(J(\\theta_0,\\theta_1)\\) in the contour plot gets closer to the center thus reducing the cost function error. Now giving our hypothesis function a slightly positive slope results in a better fit of the data. The graph above minimizes the cost function as much as possible and consequently, the result of \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_0\\) tend to be around 0.12 and 250 respectively. Plotting those values on our graph to the right seems to put our point in the center of the inner most ‘circle’. 1.8 Gradient Descent So we have our hypothesis function and we have a way of measuring how well it fits into the data. Now we need to estimate the parameters in the hypothesis function. That’s where gradient descent comes in. Imagine that we graph our hypothesis function based on its fields \\(\\theta_0\\) and \\(\\theta_1\\) (actually we are graphing the cost function as a function of the parameter estimates). We are not graphing x and y itself, but the parameter range of our hypothesis function and the cost resulting from selecting a particular set of parameters. We put \\(\\theta_0\\) on the x axis and \\(\\theta_1\\) on the y axis, with the cost function on the vertical z axis. The points on our graph will be the result of the cost function using our hypothesis with those specific theta parameters. The graph below depicts such a setup. We will know that we have succeeded when our cost function is at the very bottom of the pits in our graph, i.e. when its value is the minimum. The red arrows show the minimum points in the graph. The way we do this is by taking the derivative (the tangential line to a function) of our cost function. The slope of the tangent is the derivative at that point and it will give us a direction to move towards. We make steps down the cost function in the direction with the steepest descent. The size of each step is determined by the parameter α, which is called the learning rate. For example, the distance between each ‘star’ in the graph above represents a step determined by our parameter α. A smaller α would result in a smaller step and a larger α results in a larger step. The direction in which the step is taken is determined by the partial derivative of \\(J(\\theta_0,\\theta_1)\\). Depending on where one starts on the graph, one could end up at different points. The image above shows us two different starting points that end up in two different places. The gradient descent algorithm is: repeat until convergence: \\(\\theta_j := \\theta_j - \\alpha \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_j} J(\\theta_0, \\theta_1)\\) where j=0,1 represents the feature index number. (In Econometrics this is just the \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) here intercept and the slop for the first explanatory variable) At each iteration j, one should simultaneously update the parameters \\(\\theta_1, \\theta_2,...,\\theta_n\\). Updating a specific parameter prior to calculating another one on the \\(j^{(th)}\\) iteration would yield to a wrong implementation. 1.9 Gradient Descent Intution In this video we explored the scenario where we used one parameter \\(\\theta_1\\) and plotted its cost function to implement a gradient descent. Our formula for a single parameter was : Repeat until convergence: \\(\\theta_1:=\\theta_1-\\alpha \\frac{d}{d\\theta_1} J(\\theta_1)\\) Regardless of the slope’s sign for \\(\\frac{d}{d\\theta_1} J(\\theta_1)\\), \\(\\theta_1\\) eventually converges to its minimum value. The following graph shows that when the slope is negative, the value of \\(\\theta_1\\) increases and when it is positive, the value of \\(\\theta_1\\) decreases. On a side note, we should adjust our parameter \\(\\alpha\\) to ensure that the gradient descent algorithm converges in a reasonable time. Failure to converge or too much time to obtain the minimum value imply that our step size is wrong. How does gradient descent converge with a fixed step size \\(\\alpha\\)? The intuition behind the convergence is that \\(\\frac{d}{d\\theta_1} J(\\theta_1)\\) approaches 0 as we approach the bottom of our convex function. At the minimum, the derivative will always be 0 and thus we get: \\(\\theta_1:=\\theta_1-\\alpha * 0\\) 1.10 Gradient Descent for Linear Regression When specifically applied to the case of linear regression, a new form of the gradient descent equation can be derived. We can substitute our actual cost function and our actual hypothesis function and modify the equation to : \\[\\begin{align} \\text{repeat until convergence: } \\lbrace &amp; \\newline \\theta_0 := &amp; \\theta_0 - \\alpha \\frac{1}{m} \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m}(h_\\theta(x_{i}) - y_{i}) \\newline \\theta_1 := &amp; \\theta_1 - \\alpha \\frac{1}{m} \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m}\\left((h_\\theta(x_{i}) - y_{i}) x_{i}\\right) \\newline \\rbrace&amp; \\end{align}\\] where m is the size of the training set, \\(\\theta_0\\) a constant that will be changing simultaneously with \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(x_{i}, y_{i}\\) are values of the given training set (data). Note that we have separated out the two cases for \\(\\theta_j\\) into separate equations for \\(\\theta_0\\) and \\(\\theta_1\\); and that for \\(\\theta_1\\) we are multiplying \\(x_{i}\\) at the end due to the derivative. The following is a derivation of \\(\\frac {\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_j}J(\\theta)\\) for a single example : This would be a derivation of the loss function with respect to \\(\\beta\\) for regression through the origin with one predictor The point of all this is that if we start with a guess for our hypothesis and then repeatedly apply these gradient descent equations, our hypothesis will become more and more accurate. So, this is simply gradient descent on the original cost function J. This method looks at every example in the entire training set on every step, and is called batch gradient descent. Note that, while gradient descent can be susceptible to local minima in general, the optimization problem we have posed here for linear regression has only one global, and no other local, optima; thus gradient descent always converges (assuming the learning rate α is not too large) to the global minimum. Indeed, J is a convex quadratic function. Here is an example of gradient descent as it is run to minimize a quadratic function. The ellipses shown above are the contours of a quadratic function. Also shown is the trajectory taken by gradient descent, which was initialized at (48,30). The x’s in the figure (joined by straight lines) mark the successive values of θ that gradient descent went through as it converged to its minimum. 1.10.0.1 Additonal self note Actually, if you replace \\(\\\\h_\\theta (x_i)\\) with \\(\\theta_0 + \\theta_1*X_i\\), in the cost function then you can derive the partial derivative yourself and you will get the same results. Plus the multivariate gradient descent should come as a normal extension of what is done here. Essentially, you are holding all explanatory variables constant then mapping the slope of one explanatory variable or the intercept against the cost function. Finding the slop and adjusting the value depending on this slope and also doing all this simultaneously of course. \\(J(\\theta_0, \\theta_1) = \\dfrac {1}{2m} \\displaystyle \\sum _{i=1}^m \\left ( \\hat{y}_{i}- y_{i} \\right)^2 = \\dfrac {1}{2m} \\displaystyle \\sum _{i=1}^m \\left (h_\\theta (x_{i}) - y_{i} \\right)^2\\) \\(J(\\theta_0, \\theta_1) = \\dfrac {1}{2m} \\displaystyle \\sum _{i=1}^m \\left (h_\\theta (x_{i}) - y_{i} \\right)^2\\) \\(J(\\theta_0, \\theta_1) = \\dfrac {1}{2m} \\displaystyle \\sum _{i=1}^m \\left ((\\theta_0 + \\theta_1*X_i) - y_{i} \\right)^2\\) i.e partial derivative of the last equation with respect to \\(\\theta_0\\) and \\(\\theta_1\\). 1.11 Matrices and Vectors Matrices are 2-dimensional arrays: \\(\\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b &amp; c \\newline d &amp; e &amp; f \\newline g &amp; h &amp; i \\newline j &amp; k &amp; l\\end{bmatrix}\\) The above matrix has four rows and three columns, so it is a 4 x 3 matrix. A vector is a matrix with one column and many rows: \\(\\begin{bmatrix} w \\newline x \\newline y \\newline z \\end{bmatrix}\\) So vectors are a subset of matrices. The above vector is a 4 x 1 matrix. Notation and terms: \\(A_{ij}\\) refers to the element in the ith row and jth column of matrix A. A vector with ‘n’ rows is referred to as an ‘n’-dimensional vector. \\(v_i\\) refers to the element in the ith row of the vector. In general, all our vectors and matrices will be 1-indexed. Note that for some programming languages, the arrays are 0-indexed. Matrices are usually denoted by uppercase names while vectors are lowercase. “Scalar” means that an object is a single value, not a vector or matrix. \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) refers to the set of scalar real numbers. \\(\\mathbb{R^n}\\) refers to the set of n-dimensional vectors of real numbers. Run the cell below to get familiar with the commands in Octave/Matlab. Feel free to create matrices and vectors and try out different things. % The ; denotes we are going back to a new row. A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6; 7, 8, 9; 10, 11, 12] % Initialize a vector v = [1;2;3] % Get the dimension of the matrix A where m = rows and n = columns [m,n] = size(A) % You could also store it this way dim_A = size(A) % Get the dimension of the vector v dim_v = size(v) % Now let&#39;s index into the 2nd row 3rd column of matrix A A_23 = A(2,3) ## A = ## ## 1 2 3 ## 4 5 6 ## 7 8 9 ## 10 11 12 ## ## v = ## ## 1 ## 2 ## 3 ## ## m = 4 ## n = 3 ## dim_A = ## ## 4 3 ## ## dim_v = ## ## 3 1 ## ## A_23 = 6 1.12 Addition and Scalar Multiplication Addition and subtraction are element-wise, so you simply add or subtract each corresponding element: \\(\\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b \\newline c &amp; d \\newline \\end{bmatrix} +\\begin{bmatrix} w &amp; x \\newline y &amp; z \\newline \\end{bmatrix} =\\begin{bmatrix} a+w &amp; b+x \\newline c+y &amp; d+z \\newline \\end{bmatrix}\\) Subtracting Matrices: \\(\\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b \\newline c &amp; d \\newline \\end{bmatrix} - \\begin{bmatrix} w &amp; x \\newline y &amp; z \\newline \\end{bmatrix} =\\begin{bmatrix} a-w &amp; b-x \\newline c-y &amp; d-z \\newline \\end{bmatrix}\\) To add or subtract two matrices, their dimensions must be the same. In scalar multiplication, we simply multiply every element by the scalar value: \\(\\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b \\newline c &amp; d \\newline \\end{bmatrix} * x =\\begin{bmatrix} a*x &amp; b*x \\newline c*x &amp; d*x \\newline \\end{bmatrix}\\) In scalar division, we simply divide every element by the scalar value: \\(\\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b \\newline c &amp; d \\newline \\end{bmatrix} / x =\\begin{bmatrix} a /x &amp; b/x \\newline c /x &amp; d /x \\newline \\end{bmatrix}\\) Experiment below with the Octave/Matlab commands for matrix addition and scalar multiplication. Feel free to try out different commands. Try to write out your answers for each command before running the cell below. % Initialize matrix A and B A = [1, 2, 4; 5, 3, 2] B = [1, 3, 4; 1, 1, 1] % Initialize constant s s = 2 % See how element-wise addition works add_AB = A + B % See how element-wise subtraction works sub_AB = A - B % See how scalar multiplication works mult_As = A * s % Divide A by s div_As = A / s % What happens if we have a Matrix + scalar? add_As = A + s ## A = ## ## 1 2 4 ## 5 3 2 ## ## B = ## ## 1 3 4 ## 1 1 1 ## ## s = 2 ## add_AB = ## ## 2 5 8 ## 6 4 3 ## ## sub_AB = ## ## 0 -1 0 ## 4 2 1 ## ## mult_As = ## ## 2 4 8 ## 10 6 4 ## ## div_As = ## ## 0.50000 1.00000 2.00000 ## 2.50000 1.50000 1.00000 ## ## add_As = ## ## 3 4 6 ## 7 5 4 1.13 Matrix-Vector Multiplication We map the column of the vector onto each row of the matrix, multiplying each element and summing the result. \\(\\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b \\newline c &amp; d \\newline e &amp; f \\end{bmatrix} *\\begin{bmatrix} x \\newline y \\newline \\end{bmatrix} =\\begin{bmatrix} a*x + b*y \\newline c*x + d*y \\newline e*x + f*y\\end{bmatrix}\\) The result is a vector. The number of columns of the matrix must equal the number of rows of the vector. An m x n matrix multiplied by an n x 1 vector results in an m x 1 vector. Below is an example of a matrix-vector multiplication. Make sure you understand how the multiplication works. Feel free to try different matrix-vector multiplications. % Initialize matrix A A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6;7, 8, 9] % Initialize vector v v = [1; 1; 1] % Multiply A * v Av = A * v ## A = ## ## 1 2 3 ## 4 5 6 ## 7 8 9 ## ## v = ## ## 1 ## 1 ## 1 ## ## Av = ## ## 6 ## 15 ## 24 1.14 Matrix-Matrix Multiplication We multiply two matrices by breaking it into several vector multiplications and concatenating the result. \\(\\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b \\newline c &amp; d \\newline e &amp; f \\end{bmatrix} *\\begin{bmatrix} w &amp; x \\newline y &amp; z \\newline \\end{bmatrix} =\\begin{bmatrix} a*w + b*y &amp; a*x + b*z \\newline c*w + d*y &amp; c*x + d*z \\newline e*w + f*y &amp; e*x + f*z\\end{bmatrix}\\) An m x n matrix multiplied by an n x o matrix results in an m x o matrix. In the above example, a 3 x 2 matrix times a 2 x 2 matrix resulted in a 3 x 2 matrix. To multiply two matrices, the number of columns of the first matrix must equal the number of rows of the second matrix. For example: % Initialize a 3 by 2 matrix A = [1, 2; 3, 4;5, 6] % Initialize a 2 by 1 matrix B = [1; 2] % We expect a resulting matrix of (3 by 2)*(2 by 1) = (3 by 1) mult_AB = A*B % Make sure you understand why we got that result ## A = ## ## 1 2 ## 3 4 ## 5 6 ## ## B = ## ## 1 ## 2 ## ## mult_AB = ## ## 5 ## 11 ## 17 1.15 Matrix Multiplication Properties Matrices are not commutative: \\(A∗B \\neq B∗A\\) Matrices are associative: \\((A∗B)∗C = A∗(B∗C)\\) The identity matrix, when multiplied by any matrix of the same dimensions, results in the original matrix. It’s just like multiplying numbers by 1. The identity matrix simply has 1’s on the diagonal (upper left to lower right diagonal) and 0’s elsewhere. \\(\\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\newline 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\newline 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\newline \\end{bmatrix}\\) When multiplying the identity matrix after some matrix (A∗I), the square identity matrix’s dimension should match the other matrix’s columns. When multiplying the identity matrix before some other matrix (I∗A), the square identity matrix’s dimension should match the other matrix’s rows. % Initialize random matrices A and B A = [1,2;4,5] B = [1,1;0,2] % Initialize a 2 by 2 identity matrix I = eye(2) % The above notation is the same as I = [1,0;0,1] % What happens when we multiply I*A ?

BA = B*A % Note that IA = AI but AB != BA ## A = ## ## 1 2 ## 4 5 ## ## B = ## ## 1 1 ## 0 2 ## ## I = ## ## Diagonal Matrix ## ## 1 0 ## 0 1 ## ## IA = ## ## 1 2 ## 4 5 ## ## AI = ## ## 1 2 ## 4 5 ## ## AB = ## ## 1 5 ## 4 14 ## ## BA = ## ## 5 7 ## 8 10 1.16 Inverse and Transpose The inverse of a matrix A is denoted \\(A^{-1}\\). Multiplying by the inverse results in the identity matrix. A non square matrix does not have an inverse matrix. We can compute inverses of matrices in octave with the \\(pinv(A)\\) function and in Matlab with the \\(inv(A)\\) function. Matrices that don’t have an inverse are singular or degenerate. The transposition of a matrix is like rotating the matrix 90° in clockwise direction and then reversing it. We can compute transposition of matrices in matlab with the transpose(A) function or A’: \\(A = \\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b \\newline c &amp; d \\newline e &amp; f \\end{bmatrix}\\) \\(A^T = \\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; c &amp; e \\newline b &amp; d &amp; f \\newline \\end{bmatrix}\\) In other words: \\(A_{ij} = A^T_{ji}\\) % Initialize matrix A A = [1,2,0;0,5,6;7,0,9] % Transpose A A_trans = A&#39; % Take the inverse of A A_inv = inv(A) % What is A^(-1)*A?

We now introduce notation for equations where we can have any number of input variables. \\[\\begin{align*}x_j^{(i)} &amp;= \\text{value of feature } j \\text{ in the }i^{th}\\text{ training example} \\newline x^{(i)}&amp; = \\text{the input (features) of the }i^{th}\\text{ training example} \\newline m &amp;= \\text{the number of training examples} \\newline n &amp;= \\text{the number of features} \\end{align*}\\] The multivariable form of the hypothesis function accommodating these multiple features is as follows: \\(h_\\theta (x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 x_1 + \\theta_2 x_2 + \\theta_3 x_3 + \\cdots + \\theta_n x_n\\) In order to develop intuition about this function, we can think about \\(\\theta_0\\) as the basic price of a house, \\(\\theta_1\\) as the price per square meter, \\(\\theta_2\\) as the price per floor, etc. \\(x_1\\) will be the number of square meters in the house, \\(x_2\\) the number of floors, etc. Using the definition of matrix multiplication, our multivariable hypothesis function can be concisely represented as: \\[\\begin{align*}h_\\theta(x) =\\begin{bmatrix}\\theta_0 \\hspace{2em} \\theta_1 \\hspace{2em} ... \\hspace{2em} \\theta_n\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}x_0 \\newline x_1 \\newline \\vdots \\newline x_n\\end{bmatrix}= \\theta^T x\\end{align*}\\] This is a vectorization of our hypothesis function for one training example; see the lessons on vectorization to learn more. Remark: Note that for convenience reasons in this course we assume \\(x_{0}^{(i)} =1 \\text{ for } (i\\in { 1,\\dots, m } )\\). This allows us to do matrix operations with theta and x. Hence making the two vectors \\(&#39;\\theta&#39;\\) and \\(x^{(i)}\\) match each other element-wise (that is, have the same number of elements: n+1). 2.2 Gradient Descent for Multiple Variables The gradient descent equation itself is generally the same form; we just have to repeat it for our ‘n’ features: \\[\\begin{align*} &amp; \\text{repeat until convergence:} \\; \\lbrace \\newline \\; &amp; \\theta_0 := \\theta_0 - \\alpha \\frac{1}{m} \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m} (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) \\cdot x_0^{(i)}\\newline \\; &amp; \\theta_1 := \\theta_1 - \\alpha \\frac{1}{m} \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m} (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) \\cdot x_1^{(i)} \\newline \\; &amp; \\theta_2 := \\theta_2 - \\alpha \\frac{1}{m} \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m} (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) \\cdot x_2^{(i)} \\newline &amp; \\cdots \\newline \\rbrace \\end{align*}\\] In other words: \\[\\begin{align*}&amp; \\text{repeat until convergence:} \\; \\lbrace \\newline \\; &amp; \\theta_j := \\theta_j - \\alpha \\frac{1}{m} \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m} (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) \\cdot x_j^{(i)} \\; &amp; \\text{for j := 0...n}\\newline \\rbrace\\end{align*}\\] The following image compares gradient descent with one variable to gradient descent with multiple variables: Gradient Descent: One vs Multiple features 2.2.0.1 Additonal self note Refer back to your self note on the one feature gradient descent. Essentially, a more general partial derivative of the cost function is provided here. But the idea of mapping a a feature against the cost function, holding all other features constant, and then adjusting the slop to minimize the cost function applies. Again if you replace \\(h_\\theta\\) in the cost function with \\(\\theta_0 + \\theta_1*x^1 + ... + \\theta_n*x^n\\) and do the partial derivative of the cost function with respect to each \\(\\theta\\) then you will get the same term as shown above. 2.3 Gradient Descent in Practice I - Feature Scaling We can speed up gradient descent by having each of our input values in roughly the same range. This is because θ will descend quickly on small ranges and slowly on large ranges, and so will oscillate inefficiently down to the optimum when the variables are very uneven. The way to prevent this is to modify the ranges of our input variables so that they are all roughly the same. Ideally: \\(−1 ≤ x_{(i)} ≤ 1\\) or \\(−0.5 ≤ x_{(i)} ≤ 0.5\\) These aren’t exact requirements; we are only trying to speed things up. The goal is to get all input variables into roughly one of these ranges, give or take a few. Two techniques to help with this are feature scaling and mean normalization. Feature scaling involves dividing the input values by the range (i.e. the maximum value minus the minimum value) of the input variable, resulting in a new range of just 1. Mean normalization involves subtracting the average value for an input variable from the values for that input variable resulting in a new average value for the input variable of just zero. To implement both of these techniques, adjust your input values as shown in this formula: \\(x_i := \\dfrac{x_i - \\mu_i}{s_i}\\) Where \\(\\mu_i\\) is the average of all the values for feature (i) and \\(s_i\\) is the range of values (max - min), or \\(s_i\\) is the standard deviation. Note that dividing by the range, or dividing by the standard deviation, give different results. The quizzes in this course use range - the programming exercises use standard deviation. For example, if \\(x_i\\) represents housing prices with a range of 100 to 2000 and a mean value of 1000, then, \\(x_i := \\dfrac{price-1000}{1900}\\). 2.4 Gradient Descent in Practice II - Learning Rate Debugging gradient descent. Make a plot with number of iterations on the x-axis. Now plot the cost function, J(θ) over the number of iterations of gradient descent. If J(θ) ever increases, then you probably need to decrease α. Automatic convergence test. Declare convergence if J(θ) decreases by less than E in one iteration, where E is some small value such as \\(10^{−3}\\). However in practice it’s difficult to choose this threshold value. It has been proven that if learning rate α is sufficiently small, then J(θ) will decrease on every iteration. To summarize: If \\(\\alpha\\) is too small: slow convergence. If \\(\\alpha\\) is too large: the objective function \\(J(\\theta)\\) may not decrease on every iteration and thus may not converge. 2.5 Features and Polynomial Regression We can improve our features and the form of our hypothesis function in a couple different ways. We can combine multiple features into one. For example, we can combine \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) into a new feature \\(x_3\\) by taking \\(x_1⋅x_2\\). 2.5.1 Polynomial Regression Our hypothesis function need not be linear (a straight line) if that does not fit the data well. We can change the behavior or curve of our hypothesis function by making it a quadratic, cubic or square root function (or any other form). For example, if our hypothesis function is \\(h_\\theta(x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 x_1\\) then we can create additional features based on \\(x_1\\), to get the quadratic function \\(h_\\theta(x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 x_1 + \\theta_2 x_1^2\\) or the cubic function \\(h_\\theta(x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 x_1 + \\theta_2 x_1^2 + \\theta_3 x_1^3\\) In the cubic version, we have created new features \\(x_2\\) and \\(x_3\\) where \\(x_2 = x_1^2\\) and \\(x_3 = x_1^3\\). To make it a square root function, we could do: \\(h_\\theta(x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 x_1 + \\theta_2 \\sqrt{x_1}\\) One important thing to keep in mind is, if you choose your features this way then feature scaling becomes very important. eg. if \\(x_1\\) has range 1 - 1000 then range of \\(x_1^2\\) becomes 1 - 1000000 and that of \\(x_1^3\\) becomes 1 - 1000000000 (i.e. 1 - \\(10^9\\)) 2.5.1.1 Additonal self note The square root formulation is actually very useful as you usually have feature relations that level out after increasing or decreasing exponentially. x = seq(1:100); y = sqrt(x); y1 = 1/sqrt(x) plot(y~x) plot(y1~x) 2.6 Normal Equation Gradient descent gives one way of minimizing J. Let’s discuss a second way of doing so, this time performing the minimization explicitly and without resorting to an iterative algorithm. In the “Normal Equation” method, we will minimize J by explicitly taking its derivatives with respect to the \\(θ_j’\\)s, and setting them to zero. This allows us to find the optimum theta without iteration. The normal equation formula is given below: \\(\\theta = (X^T X)^{-1}X^T y\\) Normal Equation Optimization Example There is no need to do feature scaling with the normal equation. The following is a comparison of gradient descent and the normal equation: Gradient Descent Normal Equation Normal Equation Advantage Need to choose alpha No need to choose alpha Needs many iterations No need to iterate Gradient Descent Advantage \\(O(kn^2)\\) \\(O(n^3)\\), need to calculate inverse of \\(X^TX\\) Works well when n is large Slow if n is very large With the normal equation, computing the inversion has complexity \\(\\mathcal{O}(n^3)\\). So if we have a very large number of features, the normal equation will be slow. In practice, when n exceeds 10,000 it might be a good time to go from a normal solution to an iterative process. 2.7 Normal Equation Non-invertibility When implementing the normal equation in octave we want to use the ‘pinv’ function rather than ‘inv.’ The ‘pinv’ function will give you a value of \\(\\theta\\) even if \\(X^TX\\) is not invertible. If \\(X^TX\\) is noninvertible, the common causes might be having : Redundant features, where two features are very closely related (i.e. they are linearly dependent) Too many features (e.g. m ≤ n). In this case, delete some features or use “regularization” (to be explained in a later lesson). Solutions to the above problems include deleting a feature that is linearly dependent with another or deleting one or more features when there are too many features. ** In the econometrics discussion the problem of linearly dependnet explanatory variables make it hard to make a decision as to which of the two variables is having the observed effect on the outcome variable. i.e multicollinearity 2.8 Octave - Basic Operations % percent sign is the comment key for octave 5 + 6 % elementery operations can be done with -, *, /, ^ ## ans = 11 1 == 2 % logical operations - evalues to false - it is reprensted with 0 ## ans = 0 1 ~= 2 % The not equal to sign is thelta equal symble and not bang equal ## ans = 1 1 &amp;&amp; 0 % The AND logical operator - evaluates to 0 ## ans = 0 1 || 0 % The OR logicla operator - evalueses to 0 ## ans = 1 PS1(&#39;&gt;&gt; &#39;) % To change the octave symbole to &gt;&gt; ans = 3; % Assignment is done with = and the ; supress prints out. c = (3 &gt;= 1); % printing out results b = &#39;hi&#39;; b % just to print out b ## b = hi % for a more complex printing use disp - for display. a = pi; disp(sprintf(&#39;2 decimals: %0.2f&#39;, a)) % syntax used to print strings.

However, this method doesn’t work well because classification is not actually a linear function. The classification problem is just like the regression problem, except that the values we now want to predict take on only a small number of discrete values. For now, we will focus on the binary classification problem in which y can take on only two values, 0 and 1. (Most of what we say here will also generalize to the multiple-class case.) For instance, if we are trying to build a spam classifier for email, then \\(x^{(i)}\\) may be some features of a piece of email, and y may be 1 if it is a piece of spam mail, and 0 otherwise. Hence, \\(y∈{\\{0,1\\}}\\). 0 is also called the negative class, and 1 the positive class, and they are sometimes also denoted by the symbols “-” and “+.” Given \\(x^{(i)}\\), the corresponding \\(y^{(i)}\\) is also called the label for the training example. 3.2 Logistic regression - Hpothesis Representation We could approach the classification problem ignoring the fact that y is discrete-valued, and use our old linear regression algorithm to try to predict y given x. However, it is easy to construct examples where this method performs very poorly. Intuitively, it also doesn’t make sense for \\(h_\\theta (x)\\) to take values larger than 1 or smaller than 0 when we know that \\(y ∈ {\\{0, 1\\}}\\). To fix this, let’s change the form for our hypotheses \\(h_\\theta (x)\\) to satisfy \\(0 \\leq h_\\theta (x) \\leq 1\\). This is accomplished by plugging \\(\\theta^Tx\\) into the Logistic Function. Our new form uses the “Sigmoid Function,” also called the “Logistic Function”: \\[\\begin{align} h_\\theta (x) &amp;= g ( \\theta^T x ) \\newline \\newline z &amp;= \\theta^T x \\newline g(z) &amp;= \\dfrac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}\\end{align}\\] The following image shows us what the sigmoid function looks like: The function g(z), shown here, maps any real number to the (0, 1) interval, making it useful for transforming an arbitrary-valued function into a function better suited for classification. \\(h_\\theta(x)\\) will give us the probability that our output is 1. For example, \\(h_\\theta(x)=0.7\\) gives us a probability of 70% that our output is 1. Our probability that our prediction is 0 is just the complement of our probability that it is 1 (e.g. if probability that it is 1 is 70%, then the probability that it is 0 is 30%). \\[\\begin{align}&amp; h_\\theta(x) = P(y=1 | x ; \\theta) = 1 - P(y=0 | x ; \\theta) \\newline&amp; P(y = 0 | x;\\theta) + P(y = 1 | x ; \\theta) = 1\\end{align}\\] 3.3 Decision Boundary In order to get our discrete 0 or 1 classification, we can translate the output of the hypothesis function as follows: \\[\\begin{align}&amp; h_\\theta(x) \\geq 0.5 \\rightarrow y = 1 \\newline&amp; h_\\theta(x) &lt; 0.5 \\rightarrow y = 0 \\newline\\end{align}\\] The way our logistic function g behaves is that when its input is greater than or equal to zero, its output is greater than or equal to 0.5: \\[\\begin{align}&amp; g(z) \\geq 0.5 \\newline&amp; when \\; z \\geq 0\\end{align}\\] Remember. \\[\\begin{align}z=0, e^{0}=1 \\Rightarrow g(z)=1/2\\newline z \\to \\infty, e^{-\\infty} \\to 0 \\Rightarrow g(z)=1 \\newline z \\to -\\infty, e^{\\infty}\\to \\infty \\Rightarrow g(z)=0 \\end{align}\\] So if our input to g is \\(\\theta^T X\\), then that means: \\[\\begin{align}&amp; h_\\theta(x) = g(\\theta^T x) \\geq 0.5 \\newline&amp; when \\; \\theta^T x \\geq 0\\end{align}\\] From these statements we can now say: \\[\\begin{align}&amp; \\theta^T x \\geq 0 \\Rightarrow y = 1 \\newline&amp; \\theta^T x &lt; 0 \\Rightarrow y = 0 \\newline\\end{align}\\] The decision boundary is the line that separates the area where y = 0 and where y = 1. It is created by our hypothesis function. Example: \\[\\begin{align}&amp; \\theta = \\begin{bmatrix}5 \\newline -1 \\newline 0\\end{bmatrix} \\newline &amp; y = 1 \\; if \\; 5 + (-1) x_1 + 0 x_2 \\geq 0 \\newline &amp; 5 - x_1 \\geq 0 \\newline &amp; - x_1 \\geq -5 \\newline&amp; x_1 \\leq 5 \\newline \\end{align}\\] In this case, our decision boundary is a straight vertical line placed on the graph where \\(x_1 = 5\\), and everything to the left of that denotes y = 1, while everything to the right denotes y = 0. Again, the input to the sigmoid function g(z) (e.g. \\(\\theta^T X\\)) doesn’t need to be linear, and could be a function that describes a circle (e.g. \\(z = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 x_1^2 +\\theta_2 x_2^2\\)) or any shape to fit our data. 3.4 Logistic Regression - Cost Function We cannot use the same cost function that we use for linear regression because the Logistic Function will cause the output to be wavy, causing many local optima. In other words, it will not be a convex function. Instead, our cost function for logistic regression looks like: \\[\\begin{align}&amp; J(\\theta) = \\dfrac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m \\mathrm{Cost}(h_\\theta(x^{(i)}),y^{(i)}) \\newline &amp; \\mathrm{Cost}(h_\\theta(x),y) = -\\log(h_\\theta(x)) \\; &amp; \\text{if y = 1} \\newline &amp; \\mathrm{Cost}(h_\\theta(x),y) = -\\log(1-h_\\theta(x)) \\; &amp; \\text{if y = 0}\\end{align}\\] When y = 1, we get the following plot for \\(J(\\theta)\\) vs \\(h_\\theta (x)\\): Similarly, when y = 0, we get the following plot for \\(J(\\theta)\\) vs \\(h_\\theta (x)\\): \\[\\begin{align}&amp; \\mathrm{Cost}(h_\\theta(x),y) = 0 \\text{ if } h_\\theta(x) = y \\newline &amp; \\mathrm{Cost}(h_\\theta(x),y) \\rightarrow \\infty \\text{ if } y = 0 \\; \\mathrm{and} \\; h_\\theta(x) \\rightarrow 1 \\newline &amp; \\mathrm{Cost}(h_\\theta(x),y) \\rightarrow \\infty \\text{ if } y = 1 \\; \\mathrm{and} \\; h_\\theta(x) \\rightarrow 0 \\newline \\end{align}\\] If our correct answer ‘y’ is 0, then the cost function will be 0 if our hypothesis function also outputs 0. If our hypothesis approaches 1, then the cost function will approach infinity. If our correct answer ‘y’ is 1, then the cost function will be 0 if our hypothesis function outputs 1. If our hypothesis approaches 0, then the cost function will approach infinity. Note that writing the cost function in this way guarantees that J(θ) is convex for logistic regression. 3.5 Simplified Cost Functin and Gradient Descent - LogReg We can compress our cost function’s two conditional cases into one case: \\(\\mathrm{Cost}(h_\\theta(x),y) = - y \\; \\log(h_\\theta(x)) - (1 - y) \\log(1 - h_\\theta(x))\\) Notice that when y is equal to 1, then the second term \\((1-y)\\log(1-h_\\theta(x))\\) will be zero and will not affect the result. If y is equal to 0, then the first term \\(-y \\log(h_\\theta(x))\\) will be zero and will not affect the result. We can fully write out our entire cost function as follows: \\(J(\\theta) = - \\frac{1}{m} \\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^m [y^{(i)}\\log (h_\\theta (x^{(i)})) + (1 - y^{(i)})\\log (1 - h_\\theta(x^{(i)}))]\\) A vectorized implementation is: \\[\\begin{align} &amp; h = g(X\\theta)\\newline &amp; J(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{m} \\cdot \\left(-y^{T}\\log(h)-(1-y)^{T}\\log(1-h)\\right) \\end{align}\\] 3.5.1 Gradient Descent Remember that the general form of gradient descent is: \\[\\begin{align}&amp; Repeat \\; \\lbrace \\newline &amp; \\; \\theta_j := \\theta_j - \\alpha \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_j}J(\\theta) \\newline &amp; \\rbrace\\end{align}\\] We can work out the derivative part using calculus to get: \\[\\begin{align} &amp; Repeat \\; \\lbrace \\newline &amp; \\; \\theta_j := \\theta_j - \\frac{\\alpha}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) x_j^{(i)} \\newline &amp; \\rbrace \\end{align}\\] Notice that this algorithm is identical to the one we used in linear regression. We still have to simultaneously update all values in theta. A vectorized implementation is: \\(\\theta := \\theta - \\frac{\\alpha}{m} X^{T} (g(X \\theta ) - \\vec{y})\\) 3.5.2 Partial derivative of J(θ) First calculate derivative of sigmoid function (it will be useful while finding partial derivative of J(θ)): \\[\\begin{align}\\sigma(x)&#39;&amp;=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}\\right)&#39;=\\frac{-(1+e^{-x})&#39;}{(1+e^{-x})^2}=\\frac{-1&#39;-(e^{-x})&#39;}{(1+e^{-x})^2}=\\frac{0-(-x)&#39;(e^{-x})}{(1+e^{-x})^2}=\\frac{-(-1)(e^{-x})}{(1+e^{-x})^2}=\\frac{e^{-x}}{(1+e^{-x})^2} \\newline &amp;=\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{e^{-x}}{1+e^{-x}}\\right)=\\sigma(x)\\left(\\frac{+1-1 + e^{-x}}{1+e^{-x}}\\right)=\\sigma(x)\\left(\\frac{1 + e^{-x}}{1+e^{-x}} - \\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}\\right)=\\sigma(x)(1 - \\sigma(x))\\end{align}\\] Now we are ready to find out resulting partial derivative: \\[\\begin{align}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_j} J(\\theta) &amp;= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_j} \\frac{-1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^m \\left [ y^{(i)} log (h_\\theta(x^{(i)})) + (1-y^{(i)}) log (1 - h_\\theta(x^{(i)})) \\right ] \\newline&amp;= - \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^m \\left [ y^{(i)} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_j} log (h_\\theta(x^{(i)})) + (1-y^{(i)}) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_j} log (1 - h_\\theta(x^{(i)}))\\right ] \\newline&amp;= - \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^m \\left [ \\frac{y^{(i)} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_j} h_\\theta(x^{(i)})}{h_\\theta(x^{(i)})} + \\frac{(1-y^{(i)})\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_j} (1 - h_\\theta(x^{(i)}))}{1 - h_\\theta(x^{(i)})}\\right ] \\newline&amp;= - \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^m \\left [ \\frac{y^{(i)} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_j} \\sigma(\\theta^T x^{(i)})}{h_\\theta(x^{(i)})} + \\frac{(1-y^{(i)})\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_j} (1 - \\sigma(\\theta^T x^{(i)}))}{1 - h_\\theta(x^{(i)})}\\right ] \\newline&amp;= - \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^m \\left [ \\frac{y^{(i)} \\sigma(\\theta^T x^{(i)}) (1 - \\sigma(\\theta^T x^{(i)})) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_j} \\theta^T x^{(i)}}{h_\\theta(x^{(i)})} + \\frac{- (1-y^{(i)}) \\sigma(\\theta^T x^{(i)}) (1 - \\sigma(\\theta^T x^{(i)})) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_j} \\theta^T x^{(i)}}{1 - h_\\theta(x^{(i)})}\\right ] \\newline&amp;= - \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^m \\left [ \\frac{y^{(i)} h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) (1 - h_\\theta(x^{(i)})) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_j} \\theta^T x^{(i)}}{h_\\theta(x^{(i)})} - \\frac{(1-y^{(i)}) h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) (1 - h_\\theta(x^{(i)})) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_j} \\theta^T x^{(i)}}{1 - h_\\theta(x^{(i)})}\\right ] \\newline&amp;= - \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^m \\left [ y^{(i)} (1 - h_\\theta(x^{(i)})) x^{(i)}_j - (1-y^{(i)}) h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) x^{(i)}_j\\right ] \\newline&amp;= - \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^m \\left [ y^{(i)} (1 - h_\\theta(x^{(i)})) - (1-y^{(i)}) h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) \\right ] x^{(i)}_j \\newline&amp;= - \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^m \\left [ y^{(i)} - y^{(i)} h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) + y^{(i)} h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) \\right ] x^{(i)}_j \\newline&amp;= - \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^m \\left [ y^{(i)} - h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) \\right ] x^{(i)}_j \\newline&amp;= \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^m \\left [ h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)} \\right ] x^{(i)}_j\\end{align}\\] The vectorized version; \\(\\nabla J(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{m} \\cdot X^T \\cdot \\left(g\\left(X\\cdot\\theta\\right) - \\vec{y}\\right)\\) 3.6 Advanced Optimization “Conjugate gradient”, “BFGS”, and “L-BFGS” are more sophisticated, faster ways to optimize θ that can be used instead of gradient descent. We suggest that you should not write these more sophisticated algorithms yourself (unless you are an expert in numerical computing) but use the libraries instead, as they’re already tested and highly optimized. Octave provides them. We first need to provide a function that evaluates the following two functions for a given input value θ: \\[\\begin{align} &amp; J(\\theta) \\newline \\newline &amp; \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_j}J(\\theta)\\end{align}\\] We can write a single function that returns both of these: function [jVal, gradient] = costFunction(theta) jVal = [...code to compute J(theta)...]; gradient = [...code to compute derivative of J(theta)...]; end Then we can use octave’s “fminunc()” optimization algorithm along with the “optimset()” function that creates an object containing the options we want to send to “fminunc()”. options = optimset(&#39;GradObj&#39;, &#39;on&#39;, &#39;MaxIter&#39;, 100); initialTheta = zeros(2,1); [optTheta, functionVal, exitFlag] = fminunc(@costFunction, initialTheta, options); We give to the function “fminunc()” our cost function, our initial vector of theta values, and the “options” object that we created beforehand. 3.7 Multiclass Classification: One-vs-all Now we will approach the classification of data when we have more than two categories. Instead of y = {0,1} we will expand our definition so that y = {0,1…n}. Since y = {0,1…n}, we divide our problem into n+1 (+1 because the index starts at 0) binary classification problems; in each one, we predict the probability that ‘y’ is a member of one of our classes. \\[\\begin{align}&amp; y \\in \\lbrace0, 1 ... n\\rbrace \\newline&amp; h_\\theta^{(0)}(x) = P(y = 0 | x ; \\theta) \\newline&amp; h_\\theta^{(1)}(x) = P(y = 1 | x ; \\theta) \\newline&amp; \\cdots \\newline&amp; h_\\theta^{(n)}(x) = P(y = n | x ; \\theta) \\newline&amp; \\mathrm{prediction} = \\max_i( h_\\theta ^{(i)}(x) )\\newline\\end{align}\\] We are basically choosing one class and then lumping all the others into a single second class. We do this repeatedly, applying binary logistic regression to each case, and then use the hypothesis that returned the highest value as our prediction. The following image shows how one could classify 3 classes: To summarize: Train a logistic regression classifier \\(h_\\theta^{(i)}(x)\\) for each class i to predict the probability that y = i. To make a prediction on a new x, pick the class i that maximizes \\(\\max h_\\theta^{(i)} (x)\\) 3.8 The Problem of Overfitting Consider the problem of predicting y from x ∈ R. The leftmost figure below shows the result of fitting a \\(y = θ_0 + θ_1x\\) to a dataset. We see that the data doesn’t really lie on straight line, and so the fit is not very good. Instead, if we had added an extra feature \\(x^2\\), and fit \\(y = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1x + \\theta_2x^2\\), then we obtain a slightly better fit to the data (See middle figure). Naively, it might seem that the more features we add, the better. However, there is also a danger in adding too many features: The rightmost figure is the result of fitting a \\(5^{th}\\) order polynomial \\(y = \\sum_{j=0} ^5 \\theta_j x^j\\). We see that even though the fitted curve passes through the data perfectly, we would not expect this to be a very good predictor of, say, housing prices (y) for different living areas (x). Without formally defining what these terms mean, we’ll say the figure on the left shows an instance of underfitting—in which the data clearly shows structure not captured by the model—and the figure on the right is an example of overfitting. Underfitting, or high bias, is when the form of our hypothesis function h maps poorly to the trend of the data. It is usually caused by a function that is too simple or uses too few features. At the other extreme, overfitting, or high variance, is caused by a hypothesis function that fits the available data but does not generalize well to predict new data. It is usually caused by a complicated function that creates a lot of unnecessary curves and angles unrelated to the data. This terminology is applied to both linear and logistic regression. There are two main options to address the issue of overfitting: Reduce the number of features: Manually select which features to keep. Use a model selection algorithm (studied later in the course). Regularization Keep all the features, but reduce the magnitude of parameters \\(\\theta_j\\). Regularization works well when we have a lot of slightly useful features. 3.9 Regularization Cost Function If we have overfitting from our hypothesis function, we can reduce the weight that some of the terms in our function carry by increasing their cost. Say we wanted to make the following function more quadratic: \\(\\theta_0 + \\theta_1x + \\theta_2x^2 + \\theta_3x^3 + \\theta_4x^4\\) We’ll want to eliminate the influence of \\(\\theta_3x^3\\) and \\(\\theta_4x^4\\). Without actually getting rid of these features or changing the form of our hypothesis, we can instead modify our cost function: \\(min_\\theta\\ \\dfrac{1}{2m}\\sum_{i=1}^m (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2 + 1000\\cdot\\theta_3^2 + 1000\\cdot\\theta_4^2\\) We’ve added two extra terms at the end to inflate the cost of \\(\\theta_3\\) and \\(\\theta_4\\). Now, in order for the cost function to get close to zero, we will have to reduce the values of \\(\\theta_3\\) and \\(\\theta_4\\) to near zero. This will in turn greatly reduce the values of \\(\\theta_3x^3\\) and \\(\\theta_4x^4\\) in our hypothesis function. As a result, we see that the new hypothesis (depicted by the pink curve) looks like a quadratic function but fits the data better due to the extra small terms \\(\\theta_3x^3\\) and \\(\\theta_4x^4\\). We could also regularize all of our theta parameters in a single summation as: \\(min_\\theta\\ \\dfrac{1}{2m}\\ \\sum_{i=1}^m (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2 + \\lambda\\ \\sum_{j=1}^n \\theta_j^2\\) The λ, or lambda, is the regularization parameter. It determines how much the costs of our theta parameters are inflated. Using the above cost function with the extra summation, we can smooth the output of our hypothesis function to reduce overfitting. If lambda is chosen to be too large, it may smooth out the function too much and cause underfitting. Hence, what would happen if \\(\\lambda = 0\\) or is too small? 3.10 Regularized Linear Regression We can apply regularization to both linear regression and logistic regression. We will approach linear regression first. 3.10.1 Gradient Descent We will modify our gradient descent function to separate out \\(\\theta_0\\) from the rest of the parameters because we do not want to penalize \\(\\theta_0\\). \\[\\begin{align} &amp; \\text{Repeat}\\ \\lbrace \\newline &amp; \\ \\ \\ \\ \\theta_0 := \\theta_0 - \\alpha\\ \\frac{1}{m}\\ \\sum_{i=1}^m (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})x_0^{(i)} \\newline &amp; \\ \\ \\ \\ \\theta_j := \\theta_j - \\alpha\\ \\left[ \\left( \\frac{1}{m}\\ \\sum_{i=1}^m (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})x_j^{(i)} \\right) + \\frac{\\lambda}{m}\\theta_j \\right] &amp;\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ j \\in \\lbrace 1,2...n\\rbrace\\newline &amp; \\rbrace \\end{align}\\] The term \\(\\frac{\\lambda}{m}\\theta_j\\) performs our regularization. With some manipulation our update rule can also be represented as: \\(\\theta_j := \\theta_j(1 - \\alpha\\frac{\\lambda}{m}) - \\alpha\\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^m(h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})x_j^{(i)}\\) The first term in the above equation, \\(1 - \\alpha\\frac{\\lambda}{m}\\) will always be less than 1. Intuitively you can see it as reducing the value of \\(\\theta_j\\) by some amount on every update. Notice that the second term is now exactly the same as it was before. 3.10.2 Normal Equation Now let’s approach regularization using the alternate method of the non-iterative normal equation. To add in regularization, the equation is the same as our original, except that we add another term inside the parentheses: \\[\\begin{align}&amp; \\theta = \\left( X^TX + \\lambda \\cdot L \\right)^{-1} X^Ty \\newline&amp; \\text{where}\\ \\ L = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \\newline &amp; 1 &amp; &amp; &amp; \\newline &amp; &amp; 1 &amp; &amp; \\newline &amp; &amp; &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\newline &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; 1 \\newline\\end{bmatrix}\\end{align}\\] L is a matrix with 0 at the top left and 1’s down the diagonal, with 0’s everywhere else. It should have dimension (n+1)×(n+1). Intuitively, this is the identity matrix (though we are not including \\(x_0\\)), multiplied with a single real number λ. Recall that if m &lt; n, then \\(X^TX\\) is non-invertible. However, when we add the term λ⋅L, then \\(X^TX + λ⋅L\\) becomes invertible. 3.11 Regularized Logistic Regression We can regularize logistic regression in a similar way that we regularize linear regression. As a result, we can avoid overfitting. The following image shows how the regularized function, displayed by the pink line, is less likely to overfit than the non-regularized function represented by the blue line: 3.11.1 Cost Function Recall that our cost function for logistic regression was: \\(J(\\theta) = - \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m \\large[ y^{(i)}\\ \\log (h_\\theta (x^{(i)})) + (1 - y^{(i)})\\ \\log (1 - h_\\theta(x^{(i)})) \\large]\\) We can regularize this equation by adding a term to the end: \\(J(\\theta) = - \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m \\large[ y^{(i)}\\ \\log (h_\\theta (x^{(i)})) + (1 - y^{(i)})\\ \\log (1 - h_\\theta(x^{(i)}))\\large] + \\frac{\\lambda}{2m}\\sum_{j=1}^n \\theta_j^2\\) The second sum, \\(\\sum_{j=1}^n \\theta_j^2\\) means to explicitly exclude the bias term, \\(\\theta_0\\). I.e. the θ vector is indexed from 0 to n (holding n+1 values, \\(\\theta_0\\) through \\(\\theta_n\\)), and this sum explicitly skips \\(\\theta_0\\), by running from 1 to n, skipping 0. Thus, when computing the equation, we should continuously update the two following equations: "],
["week-4.html", "4 Week 4 4.1 Model Representation I 4.2 Model Representation II 4.3 Multiclass Classification", " 4 Week 4 4.1 Model Representation I Let’s examine how we will represent a hypothesis function using neural networks. At a very simple level, neurons are basically computational units that take inputs (dendrites) as electrical inputs (called “spikes”) that are channeled to outputs (axons). In our model, our dendrites are like the input features \\(x_1\\cdots x_n\\), and the output is the result of our hypothesis function. In this model our \\(x_0\\) input node is sometimes called the “bias unit.” It is always equal to 1. In neural networks, we use the same logistic function as in classification, \\(\\frac{1}{1 + e^{-\\theta^Tx}}\\), yet we sometimes call it a sigmoid (logistic) activation function. In this situation, our “theta” parameters are sometimes called “weights”. Visually, a simplistic representation looks like: \\(\\begin{bmatrix}x_0 \\newline x_1 \\newline x_2 \\newline \\end{bmatrix}\\rightarrow\\begin{bmatrix}\\ \\ \\ \\newline \\end{bmatrix}\\rightarrow h_\\theta(x)\\) Our input nodes (layer 1), also known as the “input layer”, go into another node (layer 2), which finally outputs the hypothesis function, known as the “output layer”. We can have intermediate layers of nodes between the input and output layers called the “hidden layers.” In this example, we label these intermediate or “hidden” layer nodes \\(a^2_0 \\cdots a^2_n\\) and call them “activation units.” \\[\\begin{align}&amp; a_i^{(j)} = \\text{&quot;activation&quot; of unit $i$ in layer $j$} \\newline&amp; \\Theta^{(j)} = \\text{matrix of weights controlling function mapping from layer $j$ to layer $j+1$}\\end{align}\\] If we had one hidden layer, it would look like: \\(\\begin{bmatrix}x_0 \\newline x_1 \\newline x_2 \\newline x_3\\end{bmatrix}\\rightarrow\\begin{bmatrix}a_1^{(2)} \\newline a_2^{(2)} \\newline a_3^{(2)} \\newline \\end{bmatrix}\\rightarrow h_\\theta(x)\\) The values for each of the “activation” nodes is obtained as follows: \\[\\begin{align} a_1^{(2)} = g(\\Theta_{10}^{(1)}x_0 + \\Theta_{11}^{(1)}x_1 + \\Theta_{12}^{(1)}x_2 + \\Theta_{13}^{(1)}x_3) \\newline a_2^{(2)} = g(\\Theta_{20}^{(1)}x_0 + \\Theta_{21}^{(1)}x_1 + \\Theta_{22}^{(1)}x_2 + \\Theta_{23}^{(1)}x_3) \\newline a_3^{(2)} = g(\\Theta_{30}^{(1)}x_0 + \\Theta_{31}^{(1)}x_1 + \\Theta_{32}^{(1)}x_2 + \\Theta_{33}^{(1)}x_3) \\newline h_\\Theta(x) = a_1^{(3)} = g(\\Theta_{10}^{(2)}a_0^{(2)} + \\Theta_{11}^{(2)}a_1^{(2)} + \\Theta_{12}^{(2)}a_2^{(2)} + \\Theta_{13}^{(2)}a_3^{(2)}) \\newline \\end{align}\\] This is saying that we compute our activation nodes by using a 3×4 matrix of parameters. We apply each row of the parameters to our inputs to obtain the value for one activation node. Our hypothesis output is the logistic function applied to the sum of the values of our activation nodes, which have been multiplied by yet another parameter matrix \\(\\Theta^{(2)}\\) containing the weights for our second layer of nodes. Each layer gets its own matrix of weights, \\(\\Theta^{(j)}\\). The dimensions of these matrices of weights is determined as follows: If network has \\(s_j\\) units in layer \\(j\\) and \\(s_{j+1}\\) units in layer \\(j+1\\), then \\(\\Theta^{(j)}\\) will be of dimension \\(s_{j+1} \\times (s_j + 1)\\). The +1 comes from the addition in \\(\\Theta^{(j)}\\) of the “bias nodes,” \\(x_0\\) and \\(\\Theta_0^{(j)}\\). In other words the output nodes will not include the bias nodes while the inputs will. The following image summarizes our model representation: Example: If layer 1 has 2 input nodes and layer 2 has 4 activation nodes. Dimension of \\(\\Theta^{(1)}\\) is going to be 4×3 where \\(s_j = 2\\) and \\(s_{j+1} = 4\\), so \\(s_{j+1} \\times (s_j + 1) = 4 \\times 3\\). 4.2 Model Representation II To re-iterate, the following is an example of a neural network: \\[\\begin{align} a_1^{(2)} = g(\\Theta_{10}^{(1)}x_0 + \\Theta_{11}^{(1)}x_1 + \\Theta_{12}^{(1)}x_2 + \\Theta_{13}^{(1)}x_3) \\newline a_2^{(2)} = g(\\Theta_{20}^{(1)}x_0 + \\Theta_{21}^{(1)}x_1 + \\Theta_{22}^{(1)}x_2 + \\Theta_{23}^{(1)}x_3) \\newline a_3^{(2)} = g(\\Theta_{30}^{(1)}x_0 + \\Theta_{31}^{(1)}x_1 + \\Theta_{32}^{(1)}x_2 + \\Theta_{33}^{(1)}x_3) \\newline h_\\Theta(x) = a_1^{(3)} = g(\\Theta_{10}^{(2)}a_0^{(2)} + \\Theta_{11}^{(2)}a_1^{(2)} + \\Theta_{12}^{(2)}a_2^{(2)} + \\Theta_{13}^{(2)}a_3^{(2)}) \\newline \\end{align}\\] In this section we’ll do a vectorized implementation of the above functions. We’re going to define a new variable \\(z_k^{(j)}\\) that encompasses the parameters inside our g function. In our previous example if we replaced by the variable z for all the parameters we would get: \\[\\begin{align}a_1^{(2)} = g(z_1^{(2)}) \\newline a_2^{(2)} = g(z_2^{(2)}) \\newline a_3^{(2)} = g(z_3^{(2)}) \\newline \\end{align}\\] In other words, for layer j=2 and node k, the variable z will be: \\(z_k^{(2)} = \\Theta_{k,0}^{(1)}x_0 + \\Theta_{k,1}^{(1)}x_1 + \\cdots + \\Theta_{k,n}^{(1)}x_n\\) The vector representation of x and \\(z^{j}\\) is: \\[\\begin{align}x = \\begin{bmatrix}x_0 \\newline x_1 \\newline\\cdots \\newline x_n\\end{bmatrix} &amp;z^{(j)} = \\begin{bmatrix}z_1^{(j)} \\newline z_2^{(j)} \\newline\\cdots \\newline z_n^{(j)}\\end{bmatrix}\\end{align}\\] Setting \\(x = a^{(1)}\\), we can rewrite the equation as: \\(z^{(j)} = \\Theta^{(j-1)}a^{(j-1)}\\) We are multiplying our matrix \\(\\Theta^{(j-1)}\\) with dimensions \\(s_j\\times (n+1)\\) (where \\(s_j\\) is the number of our activation nodes) by our vector \\(a^{(j-1)}\\) with height (n+1). This gives us our vector \\(z^{(j)}\\) with height \\(s_j\\). Now we can get a vector of our activation nodes for layer j as follows: \\(a^{(j)} = g(z^{(j)})\\) Where our function g can be applied element-wise to our vector \\(z^{(j)}\\). We can then add a bias unit (equal to 1) to layer j after we have computed \\(a^{(j)}\\). This will be element \\(a_0^{(j)}\\) and will be equal to 1. To compute our final hypothesis, let’s first compute another z vector: \\(z^{(j+1)} = \\Theta^{(j)}a^{(j)}\\) We get this final z vector by multiplying the next theta matrix after \\(\\Theta^{(j-1)}\\) with the values of all the activation nodes we just got. This last theta matrix \\(\\Theta^{(j)}\\) will have only one row which is multiplied by one column \\(a^{(j)}\\) so that our result is a single number. We then get our final result with: \\(h_\\Theta(x) = a^{(j+1)} = g(z^{(j+1)})\\) Notice that in this last step, between layer j and layer j+1, we are doing exactly the same thing as we did in logistic regression. Adding all these intermediate layers in neural networks allows us to more elegantly produce interesting and more complex non-linear hypotheses. 4.2.1 Examples and Intuitions I A simple example of applying neural networks is by predicting \\(x_1\\) AND \\(x_2\\), which is the logical ‘and’ operator and is only true if both \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) are 1. The graph of our functions will look like: \\[\\begin{align}\\begin{bmatrix}x_0 \\newline x_1 \\newline x_2\\end{bmatrix} \\rightarrow\\begin{bmatrix}g(z^{(2)})\\end{bmatrix} \\rightarrow h_\\Theta(x)\\end{align}\\] Remember that \\(x_0\\) is our bias variable and is always 1. Let’s set our first theta matrix as: \\(\\Theta^{(1)} =\\begin{bmatrix}-30 &amp; 20 &amp; 20\\end{bmatrix}\\) This will cause the output of our hypothesis to only be positive if both \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) are 1. In other words: \\[\\begin{align}&amp; h_\\Theta(x) = g(-30 + 20x_1 + 20x_2) \\newline \\newline &amp; x_1 = 0 \\ \\ and \\ \\ x_2 = 0 \\ \\ then \\ \\ g(-30) \\approx 0 \\newline &amp; x_1 = 0 \\ \\ and \\ \\ x_2 = 1 \\ \\ then \\ \\ g(-10) \\approx 0 \\newline &amp; x_1 = 1 \\ \\ and \\ \\ x_2 = 0 \\ \\ then \\ \\ g(-10) \\approx 0 \\newline &amp; x_1 = 1 \\ \\ and \\ \\ x_2 = 1 \\ \\ then \\ \\ g(10) \\approx 1\\end{align}\\] So we have constructed one of the fundamental operations in computers by using a small neural network rather than using an actual AND gate. Neural networks can also be used to simulate all the other logical gates. The following is an example of the logical operator ‘OR’, meaning either \\(x_1\\) is true or \\(x_2\\) is true, or both: 4.2.2 Examples and Intuitions II The \\(Θ^{(1)}\\) matrices for AND, NOR, and OR are: \\[\\begin{align}AND:\\newline\\Theta^{(1)} &amp;=\\begin{bmatrix}-30 &amp; 20 &amp; 20\\end{bmatrix} \\newline NOR:\\newline\\Theta^{(1)} &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix}10 &amp; -20 &amp; -20\\end{bmatrix} \\newline OR:\\newline\\Theta^{(1)} &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix}-10 &amp; 20 &amp; 20\\end{bmatrix} \\newline\\end{align}\\] We can combine these to get the XNOR logical operator (which gives 1 if \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) are both 0 or both 1). \\[\\begin{align}\\begin{bmatrix}x_0 \\newline x_1 \\newline x_2\\end{bmatrix} \\rightarrow\\begin{bmatrix}a_1^{(2)} \\newline a_2^{(2)} \\end{bmatrix} \\rightarrow\\begin{bmatrix}a^{(3)}\\end{bmatrix} \\rightarrow h_\\Theta(x)\\end{align}\\] For the transition between the first and second layer, we’ll use a \\(Θ^{(1)}\\) matrix that combines the values for AND and NOR: \\(\\Theta^{(1)} =\\begin{bmatrix}-30 &amp; 20 &amp; 20 \\newline 10 &amp; -20 &amp; -20\\end{bmatrix}\\) For the transition between the second and third layer, we’ll use a \\(Θ^{(2)}\\) matrix that uses the value for OR: \\(\\Theta^{(2)} =\\begin{bmatrix}-10 &amp; 20 &amp; 20\\end{bmatrix}\\) Let’s write out the values for all our nodes: \\[\\begin{align}&amp; a^{(2)} = g(\\Theta^{(1)} \\cdot x) \\newline&amp; a^{(3)} = g(\\Theta^{(2)} \\cdot a^{(2)}) \\newline&amp; h_\\Theta(x) = a^{(3)}\\end{align}\\] And there we have the XNOR operator using a hidden layer with two nodes! The following summarizes the above algorithm: 4.3 Multiclass Classification To classify data into multiple classes, we let our hypothesis function return a vector of values. Say we wanted to classify our data into one of four categories. We will use the following example to see how this classification is done. This algorithm takes as input an image and classifies it accordingly: We can define our set of resulting classes as y: Each \\(y^{(i)}\\) represents a different image corresponding to either a car, pedestrian, truck, or motorcycle. The inner layers, each provide us with some new information which leads to our final hypothesis function. The setup looks like: Our resulting hypothesis for one set of inputs may look like: \\(h_\\Theta(x) =\\begin{bmatrix}0 \\newline 0 \\newline 1 \\newline 0 \\newline\\end{bmatrix}\\) In which case our resulting class is the third one down, or \\(h_\\Theta(x)_3\\), which represents the motorcycle.

We denote \\(h_\\Theta(x)_k\\) as being a hypothesis that results in the \\(k^{th}\\) output. Our cost function for neural networks is going to be a generalization of the one we used for logistic regression. Recall that the cost function for regularized logistic regression was: \\(J(\\theta) = - \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m [ y^{(i)}\\ \\log (h_\\theta (x^{(i)})) + (1 - y^{(i)})\\ \\log (1 - h_\\theta(x^{(i)}))] + \\frac{\\lambda}{2m}\\sum_{j=1}^n \\theta_j^2\\) Vectorized in r as cost &lt;- 1/m * ((t(-y)%*%log(sigmoid(X%*%theta))- t((1-y))%*%log(1- sigmoid(X%*%theta)))) + ( (lambda/(2*m)) * (rep(1, length(theta)) %*% (c(0, theta[2:length(theta)]))^2)) grad &lt;- 1/m * (t(sigmoid(X %*% theta) - y)%*%X) + ((lambda/m)*(c(0, theta[2:length(theta)]))) For neural networks, it is going to be slightly more complicated: \\[\\begin{gather*} J(\\Theta) = - \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m \\sum_{k=1}^K \\left[y^{(i)}_k \\log ((h_\\Theta (x^{(i)}))_k) + (1 - y^{(i)}_k)\\log (1 - (h_\\Theta(x^{(i)}))_k)\\right] + \\frac{\\lambda}{2m}\\sum_{l=1}^{L-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{s_l} \\sum_{j=1}^{s_{l+1}} ( \\Theta_{j,i}^{(l)})^2\\end{gather*}\\] We have added a few nested summations to account for our multiple output nodes. In the first part of the equation, before the square brackets, we have an additional nested summation that loops through the number of output nodes. In the regularization part, after the square brackets, we must account for multiple theta matrices. The number of columns in our current theta matrix is equal to the number of nodes in our current layer (including the bias unit). The number of rows in our current theta matrix is equal to the number of nodes in the next layer (excluding the bias unit). As before with logistic regression, we square every term. Note: the double sum simply adds up the logistic regression costs calculated for each cell in the output layer the triple sum simply adds up the squares of all the individual Θs in the entire network. the i in the triple sum does not refer to training example i 5.2 Backpropagation Algorithm “Backpropagation” is neural-network terminology for minimizing our cost function, just like what we were doing with gradient descent in logistic and linear regression. Our goal is to compute: \\(\\min_\\Theta J(\\Theta)\\) That is, we want to minimize our cost function J using an optimal set of parameters in theta. In this section we’ll look at the equations we use to compute the partial derivative of J(Θ): \\(\\dfrac{\\partial J(\\Theta)}{\\partial \\Theta_{i,j}^{(l)}}\\) To do so, we use the following algorithm: 5.2.1 Back propagation Algorithm Given training set \\(\\lbrace (x^{(1)}, y^{(1)}) \\cdots (x^{(m)}, y^{(m)})\\rbrace\\) Set \\(\\Delta^{(l)}_{i,j} := 0\\) for all (l,i,j), (hence you end up having a matrix full of zeros) For training example t =1 to m: Set \\(a^{(1)} := x^{(t)}\\) Perform forward propagation to compute \\(a^{(l)}\\) for l=2,3,…,L Using \\(y^{(t)}\\), compute \\(\\delta^{(L)} = a^{(L)} - y^{(t)}\\) Where L is our total number of layers and \\(a^{(L)}\\) is the vector of outputs of the activation units for the last layer. So our “error values” for the last layer are simply the differences of our actual results in the last layer and the correct outputs in y. To get the delta values of the layers before the last layer, we can use an equation that steps us back from right to left: Compute \\(\\delta^{(L-1)}, \\delta^{(L-2)},\\dots,\\delta^{(2)}\\) using \\(\\delta^{(l)} = ((\\Theta^{(l)})^T \\delta^{(l+1)})\\ .*\\ a^{(l)}\\ .*\\ (1 - a^{(l)})\\) The delta values of layer l are calculated by multiplying the delta values in the next layer with the theta matrix of layer l. We then element-wise multiply that with a function called g’, or g-prime, which is the derivative of the activation function g evaluated with the input values given by \\(z^{(l)}\\). The g-prime derivative terms can also be written out as: \\(g&#39;(z^{(l)}) = a^{(l)}\\ .*\\ (1 - a^{(l)})\\) \\(\\Delta^{(l)}_{i,j} := \\Delta^{(l)}_{i,j} + a_j^{(l)} \\delta_i^{(l+1)}\\) or with vectorization, \\(\\Delta^{(l)} := \\Delta^{(l)} + \\delta^{(l+1)}(a^{(l)})^T\\) Hence we update our new \\(\\Delta\\) matrix. \\(D^{(l)}_{i,j} := \\dfrac{1}{m}\\left(\\Delta^{(l)}_{i,j} + \\lambda\\Theta^{(l)}_{i,j}\\right)\\), if j≠0. \\(D^{(l)}_{i,j} := \\dfrac{1}{m}\\Delta^{(l)}_{i,j}\\) if j=0 The capital-delta matrix D is used as an “accumulator” to add up our values as we go along and eventually compute our partial derivative. Thus we get \\(\\frac {\\partial J(\\Theta)} {\\partial \\Theta_{ij}^{(l)}} = D_{ij}^{(l)}\\). 5.3 Backpropagation Intuition Recall that the cost function for a neural network is: \\[\\begin{gather*}J(\\Theta) = - \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{t=1}^m\\sum_{k=1}^K \\left[ y^{(t)}_k \\ \\log (h_\\Theta (x^{(t)}))_k + (1 - y^{(t)}_k)\\ \\log (1 - h_\\Theta(x^{(t)})_k)\\right] + \\frac{\\lambda}{2m}\\sum_{l=1}^{L-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{s_l} \\sum_{j=1}^{s_l+1} ( \\Theta_{j,i}^{(l)})^2\\end{gather*}\\] If we consider simple non-multiclass classification (k = 1) and disregard regularization, the cost is computed with: \\(cost(t) =y^{(t)} \\ \\log (h_\\Theta (x^{(t)})) + (1 - y^{(t)})\\ \\log (1 - h_\\Theta(x^{(t)}))\\) Intuitively, \\(\\delta_j^{(l)}\\) is the “error” for \\(a^{(l)}_j\\) (unit j in layer l). More formally, the delta values are actually the derivative of the cost function: \\(\\delta_j^{(l)} = \\dfrac{\\partial cost(t)}{\\partial z_j^{(l)}}\\) Recall that our derivative is the slope of a line tangent to the cost function, so the steeper the slope the more incorrect we are. Let us consider the following neural network below and see how we could calculate some \\(\\delta_j^{(l)}\\): In the image above, to calculate \\(\\delta_2^{(2)}\\), we multiply the weights \\(\\Theta_{12}^{(2)}\\) and \\(\\Theta_{22}^{(2)}\\) by their respective \\(\\delta\\) values found to the right of each edge. So we get \\(\\delta_2^{(2)} = \\Theta_{12}^{(2)} *\\delta_1^{(3)} + \\Theta_{22}^{(2)} *\\delta_2^{(3)}\\). To calculate every single possible \\(\\delta_j^{(l)}\\), we could start from the right of our diagram. We can think of our edges as our \\(\\Theta_{ij}\\). Going from right to left, to calculate the value of \\(\\delta_j^{(l)}\\), you can just take the over all sum of each weight times the \\(\\delta\\) it is coming from. Hence, another example would be \\(\\delta_2^{(3)} =\\Theta_{12}^{(3)} *\\delta_1^{(4)}\\). 5.4 Implementation Note: Unrolling Parameters With neural networks, we are working with sets of matrices: \\[\\begin{align} \\Theta^{(1)}, \\Theta^{(2)}, \\Theta^{(3)}, \\dots \\newline D^{(1)}, D^{(2)}, D^{(3)}, \\dots \\end{align}\\] In order to use optimizing functions such as “fminunc()”, we will want to “unroll” all the elements and put them into one long vector: thetaVector = [ Theta1(:); Theta2(:); Theta3(:); ] deltaVector = [ D1(:); D2(:); D3(:) ] If the dimensions of Theta1 is 10x11, Theta2 is 10x11 and Theta3 is 1x11, then we can get back our original matrices from the “unrolled” versions as follows: Theta1 = reshape(thetaVector(1:110),10,11) Theta2 = reshape(thetaVector(111:220),10,11) Theta3 = reshape(thetaVector(221:231),1,11) To summarize: 5.5 Gradient Checking Gradient checking will assure that our backpropagation works as intended. We can approximate the derivative of our cost function with: \\(\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial\\Theta}J(\\Theta) \\approx \\dfrac{J(\\Theta + \\epsilon) - J(\\Theta - \\epsilon)}{2\\epsilon}\\) With multiple theta matrices, we can approximate the derivative with respect to \\(Θ_j\\) as follows: \\(\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial\\Theta_j}J(\\Theta) \\approx \\dfrac{J(\\Theta_1, \\dots, \\Theta_j + \\epsilon, \\dots, \\Theta_n) - J(\\Theta_1, \\dots, \\Theta_j - \\epsilon, \\dots, \\Theta_n)}{2\\epsilon}\\) A small value for \\({\\epsilon}\\) (epsilon) such as \\({\\epsilon = 10^{-4}}\\), guarantees that the math works out properly. If the value for \\(\\epsilon\\) is too small, we can end up with numerical problems. Hence, we are only adding or subtracting epsilon to the \\(\\Theta_j\\) matrix. In octave we can do it as follows: epsilon = 1e-4; for i = 1:n, thetaPlus = theta; thetaPlus(i) += epsilon; thetaMinus = theta; thetaMinus(i) -= epsilon; gradApprox(i) = (J(thetaPlus) - J(thetaMinus))/(2*epsilon) end; We previously saw how to calculate the deltaVector. So once we compute our gradApprox vector, we can check that gradApprox ≈ deltaVector. Once you have verified once that your backpropagation algorithm is correct, you don’t need to compute gradApprox again. The code to compute gradApprox can be very slow. 5.6 Random Initialization Initializing all theta weights to zero does not work with neural networks. When we backpropagate, all nodes will update to the same value repeatedly. Instead we can randomly initialize our weights for our \\(\\Theta\\) matrices using the following method: Hence, we initialize each \\(\\Theta^{(l)}_{ij}\\) to a random value between \\([-\\epsilon,\\epsilon]\\). Using the above formula guarantees that we get the desired bound. The same procedure applies to all the \\(\\Theta\\)s. Below is some working code you could use to experiment. # If the dimensions of Theta1 is 10x11, Theta2 is 10x11 and Theta3 is 1x11. Theta1 = rand(10,11) * (2 * INIT_EPSILON) - INIT_EPSILON; Theta2 = rand(10,11) * (2 * INIT_EPSILON) - INIT_EPSILON; Theta3 = rand(1,11) * (2 * INIT_EPSILON) - INIT_EPSILON; rand(x,y) is just a function in octave that will initialize a matrix of random real numbers between 0 and 1. (Note: the epsilon used above is unrelated to the epsilon from Gradient Checking) 5.7 Putting it Together First, pick a network architecture; choose the layout of your neural network, including how many hidden units in each layer and how many layers in total you want to have. Number of input units = dimension of features \\(x^{(i)}\\) Number of output units = number of classes Number of hidden units per layer = usually the more the better (must balance with cost of computation as it increases with more hidden units) Defaults: 1 hidden layer. If you have more than 1 hidden layer, then it is recommended that you have the same number of units in every hidden layer. 5.7.1 Training a Neural Network Randomly initialize the weights Implement forward propagation to get \\(h_\\Theta(x^{(i)})\\) for any \\(x^{(i)}\\) Implement the cost function Implement backpropagation to compute partial derivatives Use gradient checking to confirm that your backpropagation works. Then disable gradient checking. Use gradient descent or a built-in optimization function to minimize the cost function with the weights in theta. When we perform forward and back propagation, we loop on every training example: or i = 1:m, Perform forward propagation and backpropagation using example (x(i),y(i)) (Get activations a(l) and delta terms d(l) for l = 2,...,L The following image gives us an intuition of what is happening as we are implementing our neural network: Ideally, you want \\(h_\\Theta(x^{(i)})\\approx y^{(i)}\\). This will minimize our cost function. However, keep in mind that \\(J(\\Theta)\\) is not convex and thus we can end up in a local minimum instead. "],

In this part of the exercise, you will build a logistic regression model to predict whether a student gets admitted into a university. Suppose that you are the administrator of a university department and you want to determine each applicant’s chance of admission based on their results on two exams. You have historical data from previous applicants that you can use as a training set for logistic regression. For each training example, you have the applicant’s scores on two exams and the admissions decision. Your task is to build a classification model that estimates an applicant’s probability of admission based the scores from those two exams. This outline and the framework code in ex2.m will guide you through the exercise. 8.1.1 Data Prep Because this particular implementation is performed through R. the base code that is provided in ex2.m will not execute. Hence, the data will first have to be loaded. library(readr) ex2data1 &lt;- read_csv(&quot;ex2data1.txt&quot;, col_names = c(&quot;examScore1&quot;, &quot;examScore2&quot;, &quot;admission&quot;), col_types = cols(admission = col_factor(levels = c(&quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;)))) X &lt;- as.matrix(ex2data1[,1:2]) y &lt;- as.numeric(as.matrix(ex2data1[,3])) 8.1.2 Visualizing the data Before starting to implement any learning algorithm, it is always good to visualize the data if possible. In the first part of ex2.m, the code will load the data and display it on a 2-dimensional plot by calling the function plotData. You will now complete the code in plotData so that it displays a figure like Figure 1, where the axes are the two exam scores, and the positive and negative examples are shown with different markers. To help you get more familiar with plotting, we have left plotData.m empty so you can try to implement it yourself. However, this is an optional (ungraded) exercise. We also provide our implementation below so you can copy it or refer to it. If you choose to copy our example, make sure you learn what each of its commands is doing by consulting the Octave/MATLAB documentation. #par(mar=c(4.1, 5.1, 1.1, 8.1), xpd=TRUE) # Plot both groups pch.list &lt;- rep(0, 2) pch.list[ex2data1$admission == 0] &lt;- 21 pch.list[ex2data1$admission == 1] &lt;- 43 plot(examScore2 ~ examScore1, ex2data1, ylim=range(c(30, 100)), xlim=range(c(30, 100)), col = c(1,1), pch = c(pch.list),bg= &quot;yellow&quot;) # Add legend to top right, outside plot region legend(&quot;topright&quot;, inset=c(0,-0.0375), legend=c(&quot;Not admitted&quot;,&quot;Admitted&quot;), col = c(&quot;yellow&quot;,1), pch=c(19, 43)) 8.1.3 Warmup exercise: sigmoid function Before you start with the actual cost function, recall that the logistic regression hypothesis is defined as: \\(h_θ(x) = g(θ^T x)\\); where function g is the sigmoid function. The sigmoid function is defined as: \\(g(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{−z}}\\) Your first step is to implement this function in sigmoid.m so it can be called by the rest of your program. When you are finished, try testing a few values by calling sigmoid(x) at the Octave/MATLAB command line. For large positive values of x, the sigmoid should be close to 1, while for large negative values, the sigmoid should be close to 0. Evaluating sigmoid(0) should give you exactly 0.5. Your code should also work with vectors and matrices. For a matrix, your function should perform the sigmoid function on every element. You can submit your solution for grading by typing submit at the Octave/MATLAB command line. The submission script will prompt you for your login e-mail and submission token and ask you which files you want to submit. You can obtain a submission token from the web page for the assignment. You should now submit your solutions. # Set up a sigmoid function and test it. sigmoid &lt;- function(x){ 1 / (1 + exp(-x)) } sigmoid(Inf) ## [1] 1 sigmoid(-Inf) ## [1] 0 sigmoid(0) ## [1] 0.5 a &lt;- matrix(c(-Inf, Inf, 0, 1), nrow = 2, ncol = 2) a ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] -Inf 0 ## [2,] Inf 1 sigmoid(a) ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 0 0.5000000 ## [2,] 1 0.7310586 8.2 1.2 Cost function and gradient Now you will implement the cost function and gradient for logistic regression. Complete the code in costFunction.m to return the cost and gradient. Recall that the cost function in logistic regression is \\(J(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m \\large[ -y^{(i)}\\ \\log (h_\\theta (x^{(i)})) - (1 - y^{(i)})\\ \\log (1 - h_\\theta(x^{(i)})) \\large]\\) A vectorized implementation is: \\[\\begin{align} &amp; h = g(X\\theta)\\newline &amp; J(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{m} \\cdot \\left(-y^{T}\\log(h)-(1-y)^{T}\\log(1-h)\\right) \\end{align}\\] and the gradient of the cost is a vector of the same length as \\(\\theta\\) where the \\(j^{th}\\) element \\((for j = 0, 1, ....,n)\\) is defined as follows: Remember that the general form of gradient descent is: \\[\\begin{align}&amp; Repeat \\; \\lbrace \\newline &amp; \\; \\theta_j := \\theta_j - \\alpha \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_j}J(\\theta) \\newline &amp; \\rbrace\\end{align}\\] We can work out the derivative part using calculus to get: \\[\\begin{align} &amp; Repeat \\; \\lbrace \\newline &amp; \\; \\theta_j := \\theta_j - \\frac{\\alpha}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) x_j^{(i)} \\newline &amp; \\rbrace \\end{align}\\] Notice that this algorithm is identical to the one we used in linear regression. We still have to simultaneously update all values in theta. A vectorized implementation is: \\(\\theta := \\theta - \\frac{\\alpha}{m} X^{T} (g(X \\theta ) - \\vec{y})\\) The vectorized version; \\(\\nabla J(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{m} \\cdot X^T \\cdot \\left(g\\left(X\\cdot\\theta\\right) - \\vec{y}\\right)\\) Note that while this gradient looks identical to the linear regression gradient, the formula is actually different because linear and logistic regression have different definitions of \\(h_θ(x)\\). Once you are done, ex2.m will call your costFunction using the initial parameters of θ. You should see that the cost is about 0.693. You should now submit your solutions. # 4.

You wrote a cost function and calculated its gradient, then took a gradient descent step accordingly. This time, instead of taking gradient descent steps, you will use an Octave/-MATLAB built-in function called fminunc. Octave/MATLAB’s fminunc is an optimization solver that finds the minimum of an unconstrained function. For logistic regression, you want to optimize the cost function J(θ) with parameters θ. Concretely, you are going to use fminunc to find the best parameters θ for the logistic regression cost function, given a fixed dataset (of X and y values). You will pass to fminunc the following inputs: - The initial values of the parameters we are trying to optimize. - A function that, when given the training set and a particular θ, computes the logistic regression cost and gradient with respect to θ for the dataset (X, y) In ex2.m, we already have code written to call fminunc with the correct arguments. In this code snippet, we first defined the options to be used with fminunc. Specifically, we set the GradObj option to on, which tells fminunc that our function returns both the cost and the gradient. This allows fminunc to use the gradient when minimizing the function. Furthermore, we set the MaxIter option to 400, so that fminunc will run for at most 400 steps before it terminates. To specify the actual function we are minimizing, we use a “short-hand” for specifying functions with the @(t) ( costFunction(t, X, y) ) . This creates a function, with argument t, which calls your costFunction. This allows us to wrap the costFunction for use with fminunc. If you have completed the costFunction correctly, fminunc will converge on the right optimization parameters and return the final values of the cost and θ. Notice that by using fminunc, you did not have to write any loops yourself, or set a learning rate like you did for gradient descent. This is all done by fminunc: you only needed to provide a function calculating the cost and the gradient. Once fminunc completes, ex2.m will call your costFunction function using the optimal parameters of θ. You should see that the cost is about 0.203. This final θ value will then be used to plot the decision boundary on the training data, resulting in a figure similar to Figure 2. We also encourage you to look at the code in plotDecisionBoundary.m to see how to plot such a boundary using the θ values. # 8.

This final θ value will then be used to plot the decision boundary on the training data, resulting in a figure similar to Figure 2. We also encourage you to look at the code in plotDecisionBoundary.m to see how to plot such a boundary using the θ values. 8.4 1.4 Plot the decision boundary For logistic regression, h = sigmoid(X * theta). This describes the relationship between X, theta, and h. We know theta (from gradient descent). We are given X. So we can compute ‘h’. Now, by definition, the decision boundary is the locus of points where h = 0.5, or equivalently (X * theta) = 0, since the sigmoid(0) is 0.5. Now we can write out the equation for the case where we have two features and a bias unit, and we write X as \\([x_0 x_1 x_2x]\\) and theta as \\([\\theta_0 \\theta_1 \\theta_2]\\) \\(0 = x_0 \\theta_0 + x_1 \\theta_1 + x_2 \\theta_2\\) \\(x_0\\) is the bias unit, it is hard-coded to 1. \\(0 = \\theta_0 + x_1 \\theta_1 + x_2 \\theta_2\\) Solve for \\(x_2\\) \\(x_2 = -(\\theta_0 + x_1 \\theta_1) / \\theta_2\\) Now, to draw a line, you need two points. So pick two values for \\(x_1\\) - anything near the minimum and maximum of the training set will serve. Compute the corresponding values for \\(x_2\\), and plot the \\((x_1 x_2)\\)) pairs on the horizontal and vertical axes, then draw a line through them. This line represents the decision boundary. This is exactly what the plotDecisionBoundary() function does. \\(x_2\\) is the variable “plot_y”, and \\(x_1\\) is the variable “plot_x”. “plot_x” also adds some factors of -2 and +2 to the min and max values. This is just to visually center the plot with some margin around the edges. ** In R you need the intercept and slop of this line rather than picking any point. i.e. ** \\(x_2 = -\\frac{\\theta_0 }{\\theta_2} - \\frac{\\theta_1}{\\theta_2}x_1\\) finalTheta &lt;- ucminf::ucminf(par = initialTheta, fn = objCost, gr = grad, control = list(trace = 0))$par pch.list &lt;- rep(0, 2) pch.list[ex2data1$admission == 0] &lt;- 21 pch.list[ex2data1$admission == 1] &lt;- 43 plot(examScore2 ~ examScore1, ex2data1, ylim=range(c(30, 100)), xlim=range(c(30, 100)), col = c(1,1), pch = c(pch.list),bg= &quot;yellow&quot;) # Add legend to top right, outside plot region legend(&quot;topright&quot;, inset=c(0,-0.0375), legend=c(&quot;Not admitted&quot;,&quot;Admitted&quot;, &quot;Decision Boundary&quot;), col = c(&quot;yellow&quot;,1, 3), pch=c(19, 43, 95)) abline(a = -finalTheta[1]/finalTheta[3], b = -finalTheta[2]/finalTheta[3], col = &quot;green&quot;) 8.5 1.5 Evaluating logistic regression After learning the parameters, you can use the model to predict whether a particular student will be admitted. For a student with an Exam 1 score of 45 and an Exam 2 score of 85, you should expect to see an admission probability of 0.776. Another way to evaluate the quality of the parameters we have found is to see how well the learned model predicts on our training set. In this part, your task is to complete the code in predict.m.

During QA, each microchip goes through various tests to ensure it is functioning correctly. Suppose you are the product manager of the factory and you have the test results for some microchips on two different tests. From these two tests, you would like to determine whether the microchips should be accepted or rejected. To help you make the decision, you have a dataset of test results on past microchips, from which you can build a logistic regression model. library(readr) ex2data2 &lt;- read_csv(&quot;ex2data2.txt&quot;, col_names = c(&quot;microChip1&quot;, &quot;microChip2&quot;, &quot;qualityAssurance&quot;), col_types = cols(`1` = col_factor(levels = c(&quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;)))) X &lt;- as.matrix(ex2data2[,1:2]) y &lt;- as.numeric(as.matrix(ex2data2[,3])) X &lt;- cbind(ones = rep(1,dim(X)[1]), X) m &lt;- dim(X)[1] n &lt;- dim(X)[2] 9.1 2.1 Visualizing the data Similar to the previous parts of this exercise, plotData is used to generate a figure like Figure 3, where the axes are the two test scores, and the positive (y = 1, accepted) and negative (y = 0, rejected) examples are shown with different markers. #par(mar=c(4.1, 5.1, 1.1, 5.1), xpd=TRUE) # Plot both groups pch.list &lt;- rep(0, 2) pch.list[ex2data2$qualityAssurance == 0] &lt;- 21 pch.list[ex2data2$qualityAssurance == 1] &lt;- 43 plot(microChip2 ~ microChip1, ex2data2, ylim=range(c(X[,3], X[,3])), xlim=range(c(X[,2], X[,2])), col = c(1,1), pch = c(pch.list),bg= &quot;yellow&quot;, axes = FALSE) # set axis axis(side=1, at=seq(-1, 1.5, by = 0.5 )) axis(side=2, at=seq(-0.8, 1.2, by=0.2)) # Add legend to top right, outside plot region legend(&quot;topright&quot;, inset=c(0,0), legend=c(&quot;y = 0&quot;,&quot;y = 1&quot;), col = c(&quot;yellow&quot;,1), pch=c(19, 43)) The figure above shows that our dataset cannot be separated into positive and negative examples by a straight-line through the plot. Therefore, a straightforward application of logistic regression will not perform well on this dataset since logistic regression will only be able to find a linear decision boundary. 9.2 2.2 Feature mapping One way to fit the data better is to create more features from each data point. In the provided function mapFeature.m, we will map the features into all polynomial terms of x1 and x2 up to the sixth power. \\(\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\newline x_1 \\newline x_2 \\newline x_1^{2} \\newline x_1 x_2 \\newline x_2^{2} \\newline x_1^{3} \\newline . \\newline . \\newline . \\newline x_1 x_2^{5} \\newline x_2^{6} \\end{bmatrix}\\) As a result of this mapping, our vector of two features (the scores on two QA tests) has been transformed into a 28-dimensional vector. A logistic regression classifier trained on this higher-dimension feature vector will have a more complex decision boundary and will appear nonlinear when drawn in our 2-dimensional plot. While the feature mapping allows us to build a more expressive classifier, it also more susceptible to overfitting. In the next parts of the exercise, you will implement regularized logistic regression to fit the data and also see for yourself how regularization can help combat the overfitting problem. # MAPFEATURE Feature mapping function to polynomial features - dope # # MAPFEATURE(X1, X2) maps the two input features # to quadratic features used in the regularization exercise. # # Returns a new feature array with more features, comprising of # X1, X2, X1.^2, X2.^2, X1*X2, X1*X2.^2, etc.. # # Inputs X1, X2 must be the same size mapFeature &lt;- function(X1, X2){ degree &lt;- 6 out &lt;- as.matrix(rep(1, length(X1))) for (i in 1:degree) { for (j in 0:i) { #browser() - was used to debug your function out &lt;- cbind(out, (X1^(i-j))*(X2^j)) } } return(out) } # This is very very close to the octave file but not exact. Come back to it if you have different thetas. X &lt;- mapFeature(X[,2], X[,3]) The map feature does what is shown in the following figure. 9.3 2.3 Cost function and gradient Now you will implement code to compute the cost function and gradient for regularized logistic regression. Complete the code in costFunctionReg.m to return the cost and gradient. Recall that the regularized cost function in logistic regression is \\(J(\\theta) = - \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m \\large[ y^{(i)}\\ \\log (h_\\theta (x^{(i)})) + (1 - y^{(i)})\\ \\log (1 - h_\\theta(x^{(i)}))\\large] + \\frac{\\lambda}{2m}\\sum_{j=1}^n \\theta_j^2\\) Note that you should not regularize the parameter \\(\\theta_0\\). In Octave/MATLAB, recall that indexing starts from 1, hence, you should not be regularizing the theta(1) parameter (which corresponds to \\(\\theta_0\\)) in the code. The gradient of the cost function is a vector where the \\(j^{th}\\) element is defined as follows: \\[\\begin{align} &amp; \\text{Repeat}\\ \\lbrace \\newline &amp; \\ \\ \\ \\ \\theta_0 := \\theta_0 - \\alpha\\ \\frac{1}{m}\\ \\sum_{i=1}^m (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})x_0^{(i)} \\newline &amp; \\ \\ \\ \\ \\theta_j := \\theta_j - \\alpha\\ \\left[ \\left( \\frac{1}{m}\\ \\sum_{i=1}^m (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})x_j^{(i)} \\right) + \\frac{\\lambda}{m}\\theta_j \\right] &amp;\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ j \\in \\lbrace 1,2...n\\rbrace\\newline &amp; \\rbrace \\end{align}\\] # Regularized cost and gradient m &lt;- dim(X)[1] n &lt;- dim(X)[2] # 5.

If you have completed the cost and gradient for regularized logistic regression (costFunctionReg.m) correctly, you should be able to step through the next part of ex2 reg.m to learn the parameters θ using fminunc. Correction: objective and grad function that is passed to the fminunc call can take more than one variable. However, the variable to be optimized should be the first argument and specific value for the other variables should be passed to the advanced minimization algorithm after the objective and the gradient functions. There is also a small difference in the gradients the reason for which I did not understand at the moment. costReg &lt;- function(theta, X, y, lambda){ 1/m * ((t(-y)%*%log(sigmoid(X%*%theta))- t((1-y))%*%log(1- sigmoid(X%*%theta)))) + ( (lambda/(2*m)) * (rep(1, length(theta)) %*% (c(0, theta[2:length(theta)]))^2)) } gradReg &lt;- function(theta, X, y, lambda){ 1/m * (t(sigmoid(X %*% theta) - y)%*%X) + ((lambda/m)*(c(0, theta[2:length(theta)]))) } # Expected cost - J = 0.52900 and first 5 gradients (1.273005, 0.624876, 1.177376, -2.020142, -0.912616) regOptim &lt;- ucminf::ucminf(par = initialTheta, fn = costReg, gr = gradReg, X = X, y =y, lambda = 1, control = list(trace = 0, maxeval= 400)) regOptim[c(2,1)] ## $value ## [1] 0.5290027 ## ## $par ## [1] 1.27273642 0.62521798 1.18107445 -2.01998642 -0.91741042 -1.43161497 ## [7] 0.12409395 -0.36549642 -0.35723318 -0.17514450 -1.45818376 -0.05097913 ## [13] -0.61562760 -0.27471004 -1.19279589 -0.24211333 -0.20596939 -0.04474605 ## [19] -0.27780142 -0.29536995 -0.45637850 -1.04321107 0.02778775 -0.29246052 ## [25] 0.01555863 -0.32740993 -0.14389754 -0.92465253 9.5 2.5 Plotting the decision boundary To help you visualize the model learned by this classifier, we have provided the function plotDecisionBoundary.m which plots the (non-linear) decision boundary that separates the positive and negative examples. In plotDecisionBoundary.m, we plot the non-linear decision boundary by computing the classifier’s predictions on an evenly spaced grid and then and drew a contour plot of where the predictions change from y = 0 to y = 1.

Notice the changes in the decision boundary as you vary λ. With a small λ, you should find that the classifier gets almost every training example correct, but draws a very complicated boundary, thus overfitting the data (Figure 5). This is not a good decision boundary: for example, it predicts that a point at x = (−0.25, 1.5) is accepted (y = 1), which seems to be an incorrect decision given the training set. With a larger λ, you should see a plot that shows an simpler decision boundary which still separates the positives and negatives fairly well. However, if λ is set to too high a value, you will not get a good fit and the decision boundary will not follow the data so well, thus underfitting the data (Figure 6). # The height setting was a bit annoying. So you have to set the plotOut height as auto and then create a function inside render plot to set it to a value you want. renderPlot({ plotOutput(plotDecisionBoundary(X = X, y = y, lambda = input$lambda, initialTheta = initialTheta), height = &quot;auto&quot;) }, height = function() { 600 }) "],
["ml-programming-exercise-3.html", "10 ML - Programming Exercise 3 10.1 Introduction: Multi-class Classification", " 10 ML - Programming Exercise 3 10.1 Introduction: Multi-class Classification In this exercise, you will implement one-vs-all logistic regression and neural networks to recognize hand-written digits. You will use logistic regression and neural networks to recognize handwritten digits (from 0 to 9). Automated handwritten digit recognition is widely used today - from recognizing zip codes (postal codes) on mail envelopes to recognizing amounts written on bank checks. This exercise will show you how the methods you’ve learned can be used for this classification task. In the first part of the exercise, you will extend your previous implementation of logistic regression and apply it to one-vs-all classification. 10.1.1 1.1 Dataset You are given a data set in ex3data1.mat that contains 5000 training examples of handwritten digits.2 The .mat format means that that the data has been saved in a native Octave/MATLAB matrix format, instead of a text (ASCII) format like a csv-file. After loading, matrices of the correct dimensions and values will appear in your program’s memory. The matrix will already be named, so you do not need to assign names to them. data &lt;- rmatio::read.mat(&#39;machine-learning-ex3/ex3/ex3data1.mat&#39;) X &lt;- data$X y &lt;- data$y unique(y) ## [1] 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 There are 5000 training examples in ex3data1.mat, where each training example is a 20 pixel by 20 pixel grayscale image of the digit. Each pixel is represented by a floating point number indicating the grayscale intensity at that location. The 20 by 20 grid of pixels is “unrolled” into a 400-dimensional vector. Each of these training examples becomes a single row in our data matrix X. This gives us a 5000 by 400 matrix X where every row is a training example for a handwritten digit image. \\[\\begin{align} \\begin{bmatrix} - (x^{(1)})^{T} - \\newline - (x^{(2)})^{T} - \\newline . \\newline . \\newline . \\newline - (x^{(m)})^{T} - \\end{bmatrix} \\end{align}\\] The second part of the training set is a 5000-dimensional vector y that contains labels for the training set. To make things more compatible with Octave/MATLAB indexing, where there is no zero index, we have mapped the digit zero to the value ten. Therefore, a “0” digit is labeled as “10”, while the digits “1” to “9” are labeled as “1” to “9” in their natural order. 10.1.2 1.2 Visualizing the data You will begin by visualizing a subset of the training set. In Part 1 of ex3.m, the code randomly selects selects 100 rows from X and passes those rows to the displayData function. This function maps each row to a 20 pixel by 20 pixel grayscale image and displays the images together. We have provided the displayData function, and you are encouraged to examine the code to see how it works. After you run this step, you should see an image like Figure 1. displayData &lt;- function(X, example_width=NULL){ if (is.null(example_width)) { example_width &lt;- round(sqrt(dim(X)[2])) } # Gray Image #image(z, col=gray.colors(256)) # Compute rows and columns m &lt;- dim(X)[1] ; n &lt;- dim(X)[2] ; example_height &lt;- (n / example_width) # Compute number of itesm to display display_rows &lt;- floor(sqrt(m)) display_cols &lt;- ceiling(m / display_rows) # Between images padding pad &lt;- 1 # Set up blank display display_array &lt;- array(-1,c(pad + display_rows * (example_height + pad),pad + display_cols * (example_width + pad))) curr_ex &lt;- 1 for (j in 1:display_rows) { for (i in 1:display_cols) { if (curr_ex &gt; m) { break } max_val &lt;- max(abs(X[curr_ex,])) display_array[pad + (j - 1) * (example_height + pad) + (1:example_height), pad + (i - 1) * (example_width + pad) + (1:example_width)] &lt;- matrix(X[curr_ex,], example_height, example_width) / max_val curr_ex &lt;- curr_ex + 1 } if (curr_ex &gt; m){ break } } # Display Image op &lt;- par(bg = &quot;gray&quot;) #image draws by row from bottom up, but R indexes matrices by column, top down dispArr &lt;- t(apply(display_array,2,rev)) image( z = dispArr,col = gray.colors(100), xaxt = &#39;n&#39;,yaxt = &#39;n&#39; ) grid( nx = display_cols,display_rows,col = &#39;black&#39;,lwd = 2,lty = 1 ) box() par(op) # return(list(h, display_array)) } m &lt;- dim(X)[1] # Randomly select 100 data points to display rand_indices &lt;- sample(m) sel &lt;- X[rand_indices[1:100], ] displayData(sel) "]
